Hazard Curves
=============

Hazard Curves are discrete functions which describe probability of ground
motion exceedance in a given time frame. Hazard curves are composed of several
key elements:

* **Intensity Measure Levels (IMLs)** - IMLs define the x-axis values (or
  "ordinates") of the curve. IMLs are defined with an Intensity Measure Type
  (IMT) unit. IMLs are a `strictly monotonically increasing sequence`.
* **Probabilitites of Exceedance (PoEs)** - PoEs define the y-axis values, (or
  "abscissae") of the curve. For each node in the curve, the PoE denotes the
  probability that ground motion will exceedence a given level in a given time
  span.
* **Intensity Measure Type (IMT)** - The unit of measurement for the defined
  IMLs.
* **Investigation time** - The period of time (in years) for an earthquake
  hazard study. It is important to consider the investigation time when
  analyzing hazard curve results, because one can logically conclude that, the
  longer the time span, there is greater probability of ground motion exceeding
  the given values.
* **Spectral Acceleration (SA) Period** - Optional; used only if the IMT is SA.
* **Spectral Acceleration (SA) Damping** - Optional; used only if the IMT is
  SA.
* **Source Model Logic Tree Path (SMLT Path)** - The path taken through the
  calculation's source model logic tree. Does not apply to statistical curves,
  since these aggregates are computed over multiple logic tree realizations.
* **GSIM (Ground Shaking Intensity Model) Logic Tree Path (GSIMLT Path)** - The
  path taken through the calculation's GSIM logic tree. As with the SMLT Path,
  this does not apply to statistical curves.

For a given calculation, hazard curves are computed for each logic tree
realization, each IMT/IML definition, and each geographical point of interest.
(In other words: If a calculation specifies 4 logic tree samples, a geometry
with 10 points of interest, and 3 IMT/IML definitions, 120 curves will be
computed.)

Another way to put it is:

``T = R * P * I``

where

* ``T`` is the total number of curves
* ``R`` is the total number of logic tree realizations
* ``P`` is the number of geographical points of interest
* ``I`` is the number of IMT/IML definitions

Hazard curves are grouped by IMT and realization (1 group per IMT per
realization). Each group includes 1 curve for each point of interest.

Additionally, for each realization a hazard curve
container (with ``output_type`` equal to ``hazard_curve_multi``) is
created. This container output could be used in contexts where
you need to identify a whole group of hazard curves sharing the
same realization as when you run a risk calculation supporting
structure dependent intensity measure types.


Statistical Curves
------------------

The classical hazard calculator is also capable of producing `mean` and
`quantile` curves. These aggregates are computed from the curves for a given
point and IMT over all logic tree realizations.

Similar to hazard curves for individual realizations, statistical hazard curves
are grouped by IMT and statistic type. (For quantiles, groups are separated by
quantile level.) Each group includes 1 curve for each point of interest.

Mean Curves
^^^^^^^^^^^

Mean hazard curves can be computed by specifying `mean_hazard_curves = true` in
the job configuration.

When computing a mean hazard curve for a given point/IMT, there are two
possible approaches:

1. mean, unweighted
2. mean, weighted

Technically, both approaches are "weighted". In the first approach, however,
the weights are `implicit` and are taken into account in the process of logic
tree sampling. This approach is used in the case of random Monte-Carlo logic
tree sampling. The total of number of logic tree samples is defined by the user
with the `number_of_logic_tree_samples` configuration parameter.

In the second approach, the weights are explicit in the
caluclation of the mean. This approach is used in the case of end-branch logic
tree enumeration, whereby each possible logic tree path is traversed. (Each
logic tree path in this case defines a weight.) The total number of logic tree
samples in this case is determined by the total number of possible tree paths.
(To perform end-branch enumeration, the user must specify
`number_of_logic_tree_samples = 0` in the job configuration.

The total number of mean curves calculated is

``T = P * I``

where

* ``T`` is the total number of curves
* ``P`` is the number of geographical points of interest
* ``I`` is the number of IMT/IML definitions

Furthermore, also in that case a hazard curve set grouping all the mean curves
is produced (of type ``hazard_curve_multi``).

Quantile Curves
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Quantile hazard curves can be computed by specifying one or more
`quantile_hazard_curves` values (for example,
`quantile_hazard_curves = 0.15, 0.85`) in the job configuration.

Similar to mean curves, quantiles curves can be produced for a given
point/IMT/quantile level (in the range [0.0, 1.0]), there are two possible
approaches:

1. quantile, unweighted
2. quantile, weighted

As with mean curves, `unweighted quantiles` are calculated when Monte-Carlo
logic tree sampling is used and `weighted quantiles` are calculated when logic
tree end-branch enumeration is used.

The total number of quantile curves calculated is

``T = Q * P * I``

where

* ``T`` is the total number of curves
* ``Q`` is the number of quantile levels
* ``P`` is the number of geographical points of interest
* ``I`` is the number of IMT/IML definitions

Moreover, also in that case curves sharing the same quantile are grouped into
a virtual output container of type ``hazard_curve_multi``.

.. _hazard-maps:

Hazard Maps
===========

Hazard maps are geographical meshes of intensity values. Intensity values are
extracted from hazard curve functions by interpolating at a given probability
exceedance. To put it another way, hazard maps seek to answer the following
question: "At the given level probability, what intensity level is likely to be
exceeded at a given geographical points in the next X years?"

The resulting geographical mesh is often depicted graphically, with a color key
defining which color to plot at the given location for a given value or range
values.

Hazard maps bear the same metadata as
:ref:`hazard curves <hazard-curves>`, with the addition of the
probability at which the hazard maps were computed.

For a given calulcation, hazard maps are computed for each hazard curve. Maps
can be computed for one or more probabilities of exceedance, so the total
number of hazard maps is

``T = C * E``

where

* ``T`` is the total number of maps
* ``C`` is the total number of hazard curves (see the method for calculating
  the :ref:`number of hazard curves <hazard-curves>`)
* ``E`` is the total number of probabilities of exceedance

Note: This includes mean and quantile maps.

Statistical Maps
----------------

Hazard maps can be produced from any set of hazard curves, including mean and
quantile aggregates. There are no special methods required for computing these
maps; the process is the same for all hazard map computation.

.. _uniform-hazard-spectra:

Uniform Hazard Spectra
======================

Uniform Hazard Spectra (UHS) are discrete functions which are essentially
derived from hazard maps. Thus, hazard map computation is a prerequisite step
in producing UHS. UHS derivation isn't so much a computation, but rather a
special arrangement or "view" of hazard map data.

UHS "curves" are composed of a few key elements:

* **Spectra Acceleration Periods** - These values make up the x-axis values
  ("ordinates") of the curve.
* **Intensity Measure Levels** - These values make up the y-axis values
  ("abscissae") of the curve.
* **Probability of Exceedance** - The hazard map probability value from which
  the UHS is derived. The "Uniform" in UHS indicates a uniform PoE over all
  periods.
* **Location** - A 2D geographical point, consisting of longitude and latitude.

To construct UHS from a set of hazard maps, one can conceptualize this process
as simply extracting from multiple hazard maps all of the intensity measure
levels for a given location and arranging values in order of SA period,
beginning with the lowest period value. This is done for all locations.

Note: All maps with IMT = SA are considered, in addition to PGA. PGA is
equivalent to SA(0.0). Hazard maps with other IMTs (such as PGV or PGD) are
ignored.

The example below illustrates extracting the IML values for a given location
(indicated by `x`) from three hazard maps::

    Hazard maps PoE: 0.1

        /--------------/
       /              /<-- PGA [equivalent to SA(0.0)]
      /     x        /-/
     /--------------/ /<-- SA(0.025)
      /     x        /-/
     /--------------/ /<-- SA(0.1)
      /     x        /-/
     /--------------/ /<-- SA(0.2)
      /     x        /
     /--------------/

Assuming that the IMLs from the PGA, SA(0.025), SA(0.1), and SA(0.2) maps are
0.3, 0.5, 0.2, and 0.1, respectively, the resulting UHS curve would look like
this::

    [IML]
     ^
     |
    0.5           *
     |
    0.4
     |
    0.3   *
     |
    0.2                   *
     |
    0.1                           *
     |
     +----|-------|-------|-------|----> [SA Period]
         0.0    0.025    0.1     0.2

Uniform Hazard Spectra are grouped into result sets where each result set
corresponds to a probability of exceedance and either a logic tree realization
or statistical aggregate of realizations. Each result set contains a curve for
each geographical point of interest in the calculation.

The number of UHS results (each containing curves for all sites) is

``Tr = E * (Q + M + R)``

where

* ``Tr`` is the total number of result sets (and also the number of files, if
  the results are exported)
* ``E`` is the total number of probabilities of exceedance
* ``Q`` is the number of quantile levels
* ``M`` is 1 if the calculation computes mean results, else 0
* ``R`` is the total number of logic tree realizations

The total of UHS curves is

``T = Tr * P``

where

* ``Tr`` is the total number of result sets (see above)
* ``P`` is the number of geographical points of interest
