Core functionality for the classical PSHA hazard calculator.

The difficult part of this calculator is the management of the logic tree
realizations. Let me explain how it works in a real life case.

We want to perform a SHARE calculation with a single source
model with two tectonic region types (Stable Shallow Crust and
Active Shallow Crust) and a complex GMPEs logic tree with 7
branching points with the following structure:

Active_Shallow: 4 GMPEs, weights 0.35, 0.35, 0.20, 0.10
Stable_Shallow: 5 GMPEs, weights 0.2, 0.2, 0.2, 0.2, 0.2
Shield: 2 GMPEs, weights 0.5, 0.5
Subduction_Interface: 4 GMPEs, weights 0.2, 0.2, 0.2, 0.4
Subduction_InSlab: 4 GMPEs, weights 0.2, 0.2, 0.2, 0.4
Volcanic: 1 GMPE, weight 1
Deep: 2 GMPEs, weights 0.6, 0.4

The number of realizations generated by this logic tree is
4 * 5 * 2 * 4 * 4 * 1 * 2 = 1280 and at the end we will
generate 1280 hazard curve containers. However the independent
hazard curve containers are much less, there are actually only 9 of
them, 4 coming from the Active Shallow Crust tectonic region type
and 5 from the Stable Shallow Crust tectonic region type.
The dependent hazard curves (i.e. hazard curves by realization)
can be obtained from the independent hazard curves by a composition
rule implemented in :method:`openquake.engine.models.HazardCurve.build_data`

NB: notice that 1280 / 9 = 142.22, therefore storing all the hazard
curves takes 140+ times more disk space and resources than actually needed.
The plan for the future is store only the independent curves and to
compose them on-the-fly, when they are looked up for a given realization,
since the composition is pretty fast (there are just numpy multiplications),
faster than reading from the database all the redundant data. The
impact on hazard maps has to be determined.
