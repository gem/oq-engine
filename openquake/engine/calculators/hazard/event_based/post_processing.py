GMFs to Hazard Curves

For each IMT, logic tree path, and point of interest, the number of GMF records
will be equal to the `ses_per_logic_tree_path`. The data contained in these
records can include ground motion values from many ruptures, stored in
variable length arrays; the quantity is random.

For post-processing, we will need to perform P * R * M queries to the database,
where P is the number of points in a given calculation, R is the total number
of tree paths, and M is the number of intensity measure levels defined for the
hazard curve processing. Each of these queries will give us all of the data we
need to compute a single hazard curve.

Typical values for P can go from 1 to a few 100,000s. *
Typical values for R can from 1 few 1,000s. *
Typical values for M are about 10.

* Considering maximum for both P and R is an extreme case.

P * R * M = 100,000 * 1,000 * 10 = 1 Billion queries, in the extreme case

This could be the target for future optimizations.
