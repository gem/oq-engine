    At the end of the block the PerformanceMonitor object will have the

    .start_time: when the monitor started (a datetime object)
    .duration: time elapsed between start and stop (in seconds)
    .exc: None unless an exception happened inside the block of code
    .mem: an array with the memory deltas (in bytes)

    The memory array has the same length as the number of processes.
    The behaviour of the PerformanceMonitor can be customized by subclassing it
    and by overriding the method on_exit(), called at end and used to display
    or store the results of the analysis.
