This is an example with a source model logic tree containing uncertainties
on the fault geometry. The GMPE is fixed as the Sadigh et al. 1997 model.

The source model contains three faults SFLT1 (simple fault), COMFLT1 (complex
fault) and CHAR1 (characteristic fault). Two geometries are defined for
SFLT1 (sg1, sg2), two for COMFLT1 (cog1, cog2) and three for CHAR1
(char_simple, char_complex, char_planar)

12 curves output:
*_sg1_cog1_char_simple-*
*_sg1_cog1_char_complex-*
*_sg1_cog1_char_planar-*
*_sg1_cog2_char_simple-*
*_sg1_cog2_char_complex-*
*_sg1_cog2_char_planar-*
*_sg2_cog1_char_simple-*
*_sg2_cog1_char_complex-*
*_sg2_cog1_char_planar-*
*_sg2_cog2_char_simple-*
