This module implements supervise(), a function that monitors an OpenQuake job.

Upon job termination, successful or for an error of whatever level or gravity,
supervise() will:

   - ensure a cleanup of the resources used by the job
   - update status of the job record in the database
   - signal through an amqp exchange the outcome of the job
