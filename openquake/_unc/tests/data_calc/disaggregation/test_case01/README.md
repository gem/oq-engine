# Description of test case

In this test we use one area source (id: a) and one shallow crust fault source (id: b). Source 'a' equal to the one used in test case 02. The initial definition of source 'b' is the same of source 'b' in test case 02 but here we use a more complex logic tree. 

- Source A produces 24 realizations
- Source B produces 48 realizations
- The combination of the 2 produces 288 realizations
