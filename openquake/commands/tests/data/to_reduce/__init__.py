This is an example with a nontrivial logic tree producing 8 independent
realizations. The file source_model_2.xml contains a single area source
of kind "Active Shallow Crust": that means that the full GMPE logic tree

{"Active Shallow Crust": ["BA2008", "CB2008"],
"Stable Continental Crust": ["C2003", "T2002"]}

produces 2 pairs of identical GMPE realizations for that model.
Such realizations are managed by a single effective realization with double
weight.

The associations (et_id, gsim) -> rlzs are:
{
0,BooreAtkinson2008: ['<0,SM1,BA2008_C2003,w=0.125>', '<1,SM1,BA2008_T2002,w=0.125>']
