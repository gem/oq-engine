    Implements GMPE of Sharma et al. (2009). This GMPE is intended for the
    Indian Himalayas but is based on data from both Zagros in Iran and the
    Himalayas. The combination of these two regions is motivated by the
    sparsity of near field data. Seismotectonic similarity is supposed
    based on both regions being continental collision zones, and in spite
    of the lack of subduction in Zagros.

    Note that Figure 7-9 of Sharma et al. (2009) are in error (Sharma,
    personal communication). This implementation is verified against test
    vector obtained from lead author.

    Support for PGA has been added by assuming it to be equal to the spectral
    acceleration at 0.04 s. This is assumed by the authors in the captions for
    Figures 11-13 anyway.
