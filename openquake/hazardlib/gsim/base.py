class CoeffsTable(object):
    r"""
    Instances of :class:`CoeffsTable` encapsulate tables of coefficients
    corresponding to different IMTs.

    Tables are defined in a space-separated tabular form in a simple string
    literal (heading and trailing whitespace does not matter). The first column
    in the table must be named "IMT" (or "imt") and thus should represent IMTs:

    >>> CoeffsTable(table='''imf z
    ...                      pga 1''')
    Traceback (most recent call last):
        ...
    ValueError: first column in a table must be IMT

    Names of other columns are used as coefficients dicts keys. The values
    in the first column should correspond to real intensity measure types,
    see :mod:`openquake.hazardlib.imt`:

    >>> CoeffsTable(table='''imt  z
    ...                      pgx  2''')
    Traceback (most recent call last):
        ...
    ValueError: unknown IMT 'PGX'

    Note that :class:`CoeffsTable` only accepts keyword argumets:

    >>> CoeffsTable()
    Traceback (most recent call last):
        ...
    TypeError: CoeffsTable requires "table" kwarg
    >>> CoeffsTable(table='', foo=1)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
        ...
    TypeError: CoeffsTable got unexpected kwargs: {'foo': 1}

    If there are :class:`~openquake.hazardlib.imt.SA` IMTs in the table, they
    are not referenced by name, because they require parametrization:

    >>> CoeffsTable(table='''imt  x
    ...                      sa   15''')
    Traceback (most recent call last):
        ...
    ValueError: specify period as float value to declare SA IMT
    >>> CoeffsTable(table='''imt  x
    ...                      0.1  20''')
    Traceback (most recent call last):
        ...
    TypeError: attribute "sa_damping" is required for tables defining SA

    So proper table defining SA looks like this:

    >>> ct = CoeffsTable(sa_damping=5, table='''
    ...     imt   a    b     c   d
    ...     pga   1    2.4  -5   0.01
    ...     pgd  7.6  12     0  44.1
    ...     0.1  10   20    30  40
    ...     1.0   1    2     3   4
    ...     10    2    4     6   8
    ... ''')

    Table objects could be indexed by IMT objects (this returns a dictionary
    of coefficients):

    >>> from openquake.hazardlib import imt
    >>> ct[imt.PGA()] == dict(a=1, b=2.4, c=-5, d=0.01)
    True
    >>> ct[imt.PGD()] == dict(a=7.6, b=12, c=0, d=44.1)
    True
    >>> ct[imt.SA(damping=5, period=0.1)] == dict(a=10, b=20, c=30, d=40)
    True
    >>> ct[imt.PGV()]
    Traceback (most recent call last):
        ...
    KeyError: PGV
    >>> ct[imt.SA(1.0, 4)]
    Traceback (most recent call last):
        ...
    KeyError: SA(1.0, 4)

    Table of coefficients for spectral acceleration could be indexed
    by instances of :class:`openquake.hazardlib.imt.SA` with period
    value that is not specified in the table. The coefficients then
    get interpolated between the ones for closest higher and closest
    lower period. That scaling of coefficients works in a logarithmic
    scale of periods and only within the same damping:

    >>> '%.5f' % ct[imt.SA(period=0.2, damping=5)]['a']
    '7.29073'
    >>> '%.5f' % ct[imt.SA(period=0.9, damping=5)]['c']
    '4.23545'
    >>> '%.5f' % ct[imt.SA(period=5, damping=5)]['c']
    '5.09691'
    >>> ct[imt.SA(period=0.9, damping=15)]
    Traceback (most recent call last):
        ...
    KeyError: SA(0.9, 15)

    Extrapolation is not possible:

    >>> ct[imt.SA(period=0.01, damping=5)]
    Traceback (most recent call last):
        ...
    KeyError: SA(0.01)

    It is also possible to instantiate a table from a tuple of dictionaries,
    corresponding to the SA coefficients and non-SA coefficients:

    >>> coeffs = {imt.SA(0.1): {"a": 1.0, "b": 2.0},
    ...           imt.SA(1.0): {"a": 3.0, "b": 4.0},
    ...           imt.PGA(): {"a": 0.1, "b": 1.0},
    ...           imt.PGV(): {"a": 0.5, "b": 10.0}}
    >>> ct = CoeffsTable(sa_damping=5, table=coeffs)
