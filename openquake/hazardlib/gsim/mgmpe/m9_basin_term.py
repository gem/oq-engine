    Implements a modified GMPE class that can be used to implement the "M9"
    US 2023 NSHM basin amplification adjustment (an additive factor for long
    period ground-motions in the Seattle Basin region).
     
    This implementation is based on the description of the M9 adjustment 
    within the Moschetti et al. (2024) EQ Spectra article on the conterminous
    US 2023 NSHM GMC (pp. 1178).

    NOTE: Unknown (-999) z2pt5 values (which can be estimated from an
    underlying GSIM's vs30 to z2pt5 relationship when computing a
    basin term) are not permitted in the site model used with this GSIM
    class to avoid inconsistency between the z2pt5 used here inside the
    ``_apply_m9_basin_term`` function and the z2pt5 (potentially) used
    by the underlying GSIM to compute the pre-M9 adjusted mean ground-motion.
