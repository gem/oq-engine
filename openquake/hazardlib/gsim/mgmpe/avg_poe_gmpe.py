Module exports :class:`AvgPoeGMPE`, which can create a composite of
multiple GMPEs with different weights. The syntax to use in the
logic tree file is as in this example::

              <logicTreeBranch branchID="b1">
                <uncertaintyModel>
                  [AvgPoeGMPE]
                  b1.AkkarBommer2010.weight=0.20
                  b2.CauzziFaccioli2008.weight=0.20
                  b3.ChiouYoungs2008.weight=0.20
                  b4.ToroEtAl2002SHARE.weight=0.20
                  b5.Campbell2003SHARE.weight=0.20
                </uncertaintyModel>
                <uncertaintyWeight>1</uncertaintyWeight>
              </logicTreeBranch>

This syntax is exactly the same as for an `AvgGMPE`; the difference is
in the semantic, since the `AvgGMPE` performs averages on the log(intensities)
while `AvgPoeGMPE` performs averages on the PoEs.
