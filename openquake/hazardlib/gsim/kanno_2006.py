        Equation (5) on p. 881 predicts ground motion for shallow events
        (depth <= 30 km):

        ``log(pre) = a*M + b*X - log(X + d*10^(e*M)) + c + epsilon``

        "where pre is the predicted PGA (cm/sec^2), PGV (cm/sec), or 5%
        damped response spectral acceleration (cm/sec^2)" (p. 883) and a,
        b, c and d are tabulated regression coefficients. Note that
        subscripts on the regression coeffients have been dropped -
        subscript `1` denoted "shallow" while subscript `2` denoted "deep"
        - so that the "deep" model of equation (6) can be implemented trivally
        by changing coefficients and setting d = 0.

        Equation (8) on p. 883 gives the model used for site amplitfication:

        ``G = p*log(VS30) + q``

        Where p and q are tabulated regression coefficients.

        Equation (9) on p. 884 for the ground motion at a given site:

        ``log(pre_G) = log(pre) + G``

        No adjustment of epsilon is made as a function of VS30.
