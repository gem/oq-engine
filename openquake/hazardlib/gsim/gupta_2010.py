    """
    Implements GMPE of Gupta (2010) for Indo-Burmese intraslab subduction.

    This model is closely related to the model of Atkinson & Boore (2003).
    In particular the functional form and coefficients ``C2``-``C7`` of
    Gupta (2010) are adopted from Atkinson & Boore (2003). The only
    substantive changes are a) the horizontal component modeled is different
    (as noted below) b) a coefficient ``C8`` and a dummy variable ``v``
    are added to model vertical motion and c) the coefficient ``C1`` is
    recalculated based on a database of "a total of 56 three-component
    accelerograms at 37 different sites from three in-slab earthquakes
    along the Indo-Burmese subduction zone" (p 370).

    Equation (2) p. 373 gives the form of the equation which was fitted:

    ``log Y - C2*M - C3*h - C4*R + g log R = C1 + C8*v + sigma``

    The left-hand side of this equation was computed using event parameters
    and the coefficients of Atkinson & Boore (2003).  The regression
    coefficients C1 and C8 on the right-hand side were slightly smoothed
    after fitting. Note that since "v=0 for horizontal and 1 for vertical
    motion", and since the current implementation only models horizontal
    motion, we can subclass directly from
    :class:`openquake.hazardlib.gsim.atkinson_boore_2003.AtkinsonBoore2003SSlab`,
    modifying only the metadata constants and regression coefficients.

    Page number citations in this documentation refer to Gupta (2010).
