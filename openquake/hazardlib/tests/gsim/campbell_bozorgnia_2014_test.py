Implements the comprehensive test suite for the Campbell & Bozorgnia (2014)

Test data generated using the Excel file published as supplementary material
with the V/H Earthquake Spectra paper from the same authors:
https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/suppl/10.1193/100614eqs151m

# Take note of the following bug in the 'HOR Spectrum (PSA)' Sheet of
# the supplemental Excel file:
#   * Formula error in cell A62 and Column L, i.e. the formula for f_sed
#     (Basin Response Term) should refer to the Sj flag instead of the Sji flag
#   * A1100 should refer to Z2.5 (VS30=1100) in Cell B48, not constant in A48.
