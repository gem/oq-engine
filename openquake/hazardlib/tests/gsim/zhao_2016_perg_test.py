    openquake.hazardlib.tests.gsim.data.ZHAO16PERG. Multiple spectral ordinates
    are also considered.

    The test scenarios below consider sites generated w.r.t. the same rupture,
    but with different site azimuths, resulting in different travel path
    configurations through these volcanic zone polygons. The expected distances
    for many scenarios also not considered here were measured using QGIS, and
    excellent matches were observed when compared against the values computed
    using the ray tracing functions implemented here. These ray-tracing
    functions are found within
    openquake.hazardlib.gsim.zhao_2016_volc_perg.volc_perg

    The tests below test the execution of the non-ergodic implementation
    of ZhaoEtAlSSlabPErg, and demonstrate the difference in predicted
    ground-motion if these path modifications are considered.
