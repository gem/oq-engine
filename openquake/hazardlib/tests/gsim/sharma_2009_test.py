    Test data were obtained via personal communications with the
    lead author in the form of an Excel spreadsheet. The most
    significant modification required to obtain the ``MEAN_FILE``
    was to convert from m/s^2 to g. Results were also verified
    against the published versions of Figures 6-9, digitized using
    http://arohatgi.info/WebPlotDigitizer/ app/. Agreement was
    excellent at 0.04 s for all magitudes, distances, mechanisms,
    and site conditions (Figure 6). For other periods (Figures 7-9)
    the results diverged, up to about 20%. Finally, in personal
    communication with the lead author, alternative versions of
    Figures 7-9 were provided which visually match both this
    implementation and the author-generated ``MEAN_FILE`` well.

    There is no plot of residuals as a function of frequency, so
    there's absolutely nothing to verify that against. That said,
    sigma provided is a simple lookup per spectral acceleration
    period.
