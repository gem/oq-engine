    # NOTE: we found that sometimes broken pyproj wheels cause a very tricky behavior,
    # so the order in which some libraries are imported causes different effects.
    # We had a case in which importing hazardlib and then pyproj caused the application
    # to suddenly exit without giving any kind of error message.
    # In the following test, we assume that hazardlib has already been imported and we
    # attempt to import pyproj. A complementary test importing first pyproj then
    # hazardlib was added to baselib.
