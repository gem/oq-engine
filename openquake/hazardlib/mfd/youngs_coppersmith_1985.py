    Class implementing the MFD for the 'Characteristic Earthquake Model' as
    described in: "Implications of fault slip rates and earthquake recurrence
    models to probabilistic seismic hazard estimates", by Robert R. Youngs and
    Kevin J. Coppersmith and published in Bulletin of the Seismological
    Society of America, Vol. 75, No. 4, pages 939-964, 1985.
    The class implements the MFD under the following assumptions as reported
    at page 954:

    1) Δ_mc (width of the boxcar distribution representing characteristic
       rate) is equal to 0.5 magnitude unit
    2) m' (maximum magnitude value for the Gutenberg-Richeter part of the
       distribution) is equal to the absolute maximum magnitude minus Δ_mc
       (that is there is no gap between the Gutenberg-Richter distribution and
       the boxcar distribution)
    3) the rate of events at the characteristic magnitude is equal to the
       rate of events for magnitude equal to m' - 1

    :param min_mag:
        The lowest possible magnitude for the MFD. The first bin in the
        :meth:`result histogram <get_annual_occurrence_rates>` is aligned
        to make its left border match this value.
    :param a_val:
        The Gutenberg-Richter ``a`` value -- the intercept of the loglinear
        cumulative G-R relationship.
    :param b_val:
        The Gutenberg-Richter ``b`` value -- the gradient of the loglinear
        G-R relationship.
    :param char_mag:
        The characteristic magnitude defining the middle point of the
        characteristic distribution. That is the boxcar function representing
        the characteristic distribution is defined in the range
        [char_mag - 0.25, char_mag + 0.25].
    :param char_rate:
        The characteristic rate associated to the characteristic magnitude,
        to be distributed over the domain of the boxcar function representing
        the characteristic distribution (that is λ_char = char_rate / 0.5)
    :param bin_width:
        A positive float value -- the width of a single histogram bin.

    Values for ``min_mag`` and the maximum magnitude (char_mag + 0.25) don't
    have to be aligned with respect to ``bin_width``. They get rounded
    accordingly anyway so that both are divisible by ``bin_width`` just before
    converting a function to a histogram.
