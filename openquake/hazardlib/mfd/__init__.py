A Magnitude Frequency Distribution (MFD) is a function that describes the rate
(per year) of earthquakes across all magnitudes.

Package `mfd` contains the basic class for MFD --
:class:`openquake.hazardlib.mfd.base.BaseMFD`, and three actual
implementations:
:class:`openquake.hazardlib.mfd.evenly_discretized.EvenlyDiscretizedMFD`
:class:`openquake.hazardlib.mfd.truncated_gr.TruncatedGRMFD` and
:class:`openquake.hazardlib.mfd.youngs_coppersmith_1985.YoungsCoppersmith1985MFD`.
