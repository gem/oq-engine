    """
    Get the Direct Point and the corresponding E-path as described in
    Spudich et al. (2013). This method also provides a logical variable
    stating if the DPP calculation must consider the neighbouring patch.
    To define the intersection point(Pd) of PpPh line segment and fault plane,
    we obtain the intersection points(Pd) with each side of fault plan, and
    check which intersection point(Pd) is the one fitting the definition in
    the Chiou and Spudich(2014) directivity model.
    Two possible locations for Pd, the first case, Pd locates on the side of
    the fault patch when Pp is not inside the fault patch. The second case is
    when Pp is inside the fault patch, then Pd=Pp.

    For the first case, it follows three conditions:
    1. the PpPh and PdPh line vector are the same,
    2. PpPh >= PdPh,
    3. Pd is not inside the fault patch.

    If we can not find solution for all the four possible intersection points
    for the first case, we check if the intersection point fit the second case
    by checking if Pp is inside the fault patch.

    Because of the coordinate system mapping(from geographic system to
    Catestian system), we allow an error when we check the location. The allow
    error will keep increasing after each loop when no solution in the two
    cases are found, until the solution get obtained.
