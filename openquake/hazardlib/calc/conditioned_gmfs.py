This module implements the process for conditioning ground motion
fields upon recorded strong motion station data or macroseismic
intensity observations described in Engler et al. (2022)
Engler, D. T., Worden, C. B., Thompson, E. M., & Jaiswal, K. S. (2022).
Partitioning Ground Motion Uncertainty When Conditioned on Station Data.
Bulletin of the Seismological Society of America, 112(2), 1060–1079.
https://doi.org/10.1785/0120210177

The USGS ShakeMap implementation of Engler et al. (2022) is described
in detail at: https://usgs.github.io/shakemap/manual4_0/tg_processing.html
and the bulk of the implementation code resides in the ShakeMap Model module:
https://code.usgs.gov/ghsc/esi/shakemap-modules/-/blob/main/src/shakemap_modules/coremods/model.py?

This implementation is intended for generating conditional random
ground motion fields for downstream use with the OpenQuake scenario
damage and loss calculators, such that users can provide a station
data file containing both seismic and macroseismic stations, where
and specify a list of target IMTs and list of sites for which the
OpenQuake engine will calculate the conditioned mean and covariance
of the ground shaking following Engler et al. (2022), and then
simulate the requested number of ground motion fields

    This function clips the eigenvalues, replacing eigenvalues smaller than

    Compared to corr_nearest, the distance between the original correlation
    matrix and the positive definite correlation matrix is larger, however,

    Parameters
    ----------

    threshold : float

    Returns
    -------
    corr_new : ndarray, (optional)

    Notes
    -----
    The smallest eigenvalue of the corrected correlation matrix is
    approximately equal to the ``threshold``. In examples, the
    smallest eigenvalue can be by a factor of 10 smaller than the threshold,
    e.g. threshold 1e-8 can result in smallest eigenvalue in the range
    between 1e-9 and 1e-8.
    If the threshold=0, then the smallest eigenvalue of the correlation matrix
    might be negative, but zero within a numerical error, for example in the

    If the correlation matrix is already positive semi-definite given the
