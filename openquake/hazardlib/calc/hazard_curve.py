""":mod:`openquake.hazardlib.calc.hazard_curve` implements
:func:`calc_hazard_curves`. Here is an example of a classical PSHA
parallel calculator computing the hazard curves per each realization in less
than 20 lines of code:

.. code-block:: python

   import sys
   from openquake.commonlib import logs
   from openquake.calculators.base import calculators

   def main(job_ini):
       with logs.init(job_ini) as log:
           calc = calculators(log.get_oqparam(), log.calc_id)
           calc.run(individual_rlzs='true', shutdown=True)
           print('The hazard curves are in %s::/hcurves-rlzs'
                % calc.datastore.filename)

   if __name__ == '__main__':
       main(sys.argv[1])  # path to a job.ini file

NB: the implementation in the engine is smarter and more
efficient. Here we start a parallel computation per each realization,
the engine manages all the realizations at once.
