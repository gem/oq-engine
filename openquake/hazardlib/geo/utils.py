    Callable OrthographicProjection object that can perform both forward

    and y values on 2d-space and vice versa). The call takes three
    arguments: first two are numpy arrays of longitudes and latitudes *or*
    abscissae and ordinates of points to project and the third one
    is a boolean that allows to choose what operation is requested --
    is it forward or reverse one. ``True`` value given to third
    positional argument (or keyword argument "reverse") indicates
    that the projection of points in 2d space back to earth surface
    is needed. The default value for "reverse" argument is ``False``,
    which means forward projection (degrees to kilometers).

    Raises ``ValueError`` in forward projection
    mode if any of the target points is further than 90 degree
    (along the great circle arc) from the projection center.

    Parameters are given as floats, representing decimal degrees (first two
    are longitudes and last two are latitudes). They define a bounding box
    in a spherical coordinates of the collection of points that is about
    to be projected. The center point of the projection (coordinates (0, 0)
    in Cartesian space) is set to the middle point of that bounding box.
    The resulting projection is defined for spherical coordinates that are
    not further from the bounding box center than 90 degree on the great
    circle arc.

    The result projection is of type `Orthographic
    <http://mathworld.wolfram.com/OrthographicProjection.html>`_.
    This projection is prone to distance, area and angle distortions
    everywhere outside of the center point, but still can be used for
    checking shapes: verifying if line intersects itself (like in
    :func:`line_intersects_itself`) or if point is inside of a polygon
    (like in :meth:`openquake.hazardlib.geo.polygon.Polygon.discretize`). It
    can be also used for measuring distance to an extent of around 700
