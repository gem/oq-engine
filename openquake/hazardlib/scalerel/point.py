    Implements magnitude-area scaling relationship to mimic point ruptures.
    Independently of the magnitude value, this scaling relationship returns

    square) for the median area.

    NOTE: This scaling-relationship is meant to be used in area and point
    sources to mimic point ruptures. Is not intended to be used in fault
    sources, as it would require a fault surface discretization step to small
    (less than 10 m, using an aspect ratio equal to 1) which is unfeasible for
    realistic applications.
