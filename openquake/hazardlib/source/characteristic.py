    """
    Characteristic source typology represents seismicity occuring on a generic
    fault surface with seismic events rupturing the entire fault surface
    independently of their magnitude values.

    Characteristic source typology can be used to model individual faults
    or fault segments that tend to produce essentialy same size earthquakes
    (see for instance: Schwartz, D. P., K. J. Coppersmith, Fault behavior and
    characteristic earthquakes: Examples from the Wasatch and San Andreas fault
    zones, J. Geophys. Res., 89, 5681-5698, 1984)

    :param surface:
        Fault surface, see :mod:`openquake.hazardlib.geo.surface`.
    :param rake:
        Angle describing rupture propagation direction in decimal degrees.

    See also :class:`openquake.hazardlib.source.base.ParametricSeismicSource`
    for description of other parameters.

    Note that a ``CharacteristicFaultSource`` does not need any mesh spacing,
    magnitude scaling relationship, and aspect ratio, therefore the constructor
    sets these parameters to ``None``.

    NB: if you want to convert a characteristic source into XML, you must set
    its attribute `surface_node` to an explicit representation of the surface
    as a LiteralNode object.
