Description:  OpenQuake Risklib is an open source library for seismic risk
 assessment, which includes several modules capable of calculating losses and
 damage distributions for a scenario earthquake, or for calculating
 probabilistic risk from all the possible events that might occur in a region
 within a certain time span (that can be estimated through an event-based
 approach, or a classical PSHA-based approach). The main outputs of this
 library are loss statistics, loss maps, loss curves, damage distributions
 and collapse maps.
 The GEM Foundation (http://www.globalquakemodel.org/) supports the development
 of this library by adding the most common methodologies used by seismic risk
 modellers. Comments, suggestions and criticisms from the community are always
 very welcome.
