  [Michele Simionato]
  * `iml_disagg` and `poes_disagg` cannot coexist in the job.ini file
  * Added a check on `conditional_loss_poes` in the event_based_risk calculator:

  [Michele Simionato]
  * Optimized the disaggregation calculation by performing the PMF extraction
    only once at the end of the calculation and not in the workers
  * Added an `oq zip` command
  * Avoided running an useless classical calculation if `iml_disagg` is given

  [Valerio Poggi]
  * Implemented subclasses for ZhaoEtAl2006Asc and AtkinsonBoore2006 to account

    calculator and reduced the data transfer by the number of tectonic
    region types

    MultiPointSources
  * Better error message if the user sets a wrong site_id in the sites.csv file

  * Change the ordering of the TRT bins in disaggregation: now they are
    ordered lexicographically
  * Added more validity checks on the job.ini file for disaggregation
  * Changed the .hdf5 format generated by `oq extract -1 hazard/rlzs`; you can
    still produce the old format by using `oq extract -1 qgis-hazard/rlzs`
  * Optimized the disaggregation calculator by instantiating
    `scipy.stats.truncnorm` only once per task and not once per rupture

    and changed the default for the avg_losses flag to True
  * WebUI: now every job runs in its own process and has name oq-job-<ID>
  * Refactored the WebUI tests to use the DbServer and django.test.Client
  * Added an experimental feature `optimize_same_id_sources`
  * Fixed a bug in gmf_ebrisk when there are zero losses and added more
    validity checks on the CSV file
  * The parameter `number_of_ground_motion_fields` is back to being optional in
    scenario calculators reading the GMFs from a file, since it can be inferred
  * Removed the deprecated risk outputs dmg_by_tag, dmg_total,
    losses_by_tag, losses_total
  * Deprecated the .geojson exporters for hazard curves and maps
  * We now keep the realization weights in case of logic tree sampling (before
    they were rescaled to 1 / R and considered all equals)
  * Optimized sampling for extra-large logic trees
  * Added a check on missing `source_model_logic_tree`
  * Fix to the gmf_ebrisk calculator: the realization index in the event loss
    table was incorrect and too many rows were saved

    variable in the job.ini (experimental)
  * Fixed the precedence order when reading openquake.cfd

python-oq-engine (1.5.0-0~precise01) precise; urgency=low

  [Michele Simionato]
  * The event based calculators in the engine are now officially deprecated
    and they raise a warning when used
  * Optimization: we do not generate the full epsilon matrix if all
    coefficients of variation are zero
  * Fixed two subtle bugs in the management of the epsilons: it means that
    all event based risk calculations with nonzero coefficients of variations
    will produce slightly different numbers with respect to before
  * Removed excessive checking on the exposure attributes 'deductible' and
    'insuredLimit' that made it impossible to run legitimate calculations
  * Changed the meaning of 'average_loss' for the aggregated curves: now it
    is the sum of the aggregated losses in the event loss table,
    before it was extracted from the aggregated loss curve
  * Changed the way the average losses (and insured average losses) are
    computed by the event based risk calculator: now they are extracted
    from the event loss table, before they were extracted from the loss curves
  * Set to NULL the stddev_losses and stddev_insured_losses for the event based
    risk calculator, since they were computed incorrectly
  * Introduced a new experimental command
    'oq-engine --show-view CALCULATION_ID VIEW_NAME'; the only view available
    for the moment is 'mean_avg_losses'
  * Negative calculation IDs are interpreted in a Pythonic way, i.e. -1
    means the last calculation, -2 the calculation before the last one, etc.
  * If a site parameter is more distant than 5 kilometers from its closest
    site, a warning is logged
  * Changed the splitting of fault sources to reduce the number of generated
    sources and avoid data transfer failures if rupture_mesh_spacing is too
    small
  * Changed the event loss table export: now the CSV file does not contain
    the magnitude and the rows are ordered by rupture tag first and loss second
  * Removed the calculator EventBasedBCR
  * Longitude and latitude are now rounded to 5 digits
  * Fixed a very subtle bug in the vulnerability functions, potentially
    affecting calculations with nonzero coefficients of variation and nonzero
    minIML; the numbers produced by the engine were incorrect; see
    https://bugs.launchpad.net/oq-engine/+bug/1459926
  * 'investigation_time' has been replaced by 'risk_investigation_time' in
    risk configuration files

  [Michele Simionato]
  * Renamed the maximum_distance parameter of the risk calculators to
    asset_hazard_distance, to avoid confusion with the maximum_distance
    parameter of the hazard calculators, which has a different meaning;
    is it an error to set the maximum_distance in a job_risk.ini file
  * Added to the API an URL /v1/calc/:calc_id/remove to hide jobs
  * A new key is_running is added to the list of dictionaries returned by
    the URL /v1/calc/list

    and the worker nodes
  * Bypassed Django when deleting calculations from the database: this avoids
    running out of memory for large calculations
  * Fixed an issue in the scenario calculator: the GMFs were not filtered
    according to the distance to the rupture
  * Now critical errors appear in the log file
  * Added a --run command to run hazard and risk together
  * Fixed bug in the event based calculator; in the case
    number_of_logic_tree_samples > 0 it was generating incorrect hazard curves.
    Also improved (a lot) the performance in this case.
  * Fixed a tricky bug happening when some tectonic region type are filtered
    away.
  * The event based risk calculator now save only the non-zero losses in
    the table event_loss_asset.
  * Added a CSV exporter for the Stochastic Event Sets, for debugging purposes.
  * The GMF CSV exporter now sorts the output by rupture tag.

  [Michele Simionato]
  * Updated python-django dependency >= 1.6.1, (our repository already
    includes a backported version for Ubuntu 'precise' 12.04); this change
    makes unnecessary "standard_conforming_strings" postgresql configuration
    variable setting
  * The event based risk calculator is able to disaggregate the event loss
    table per asset. To enable this feature, just list the assets you are
    interested in in the job.ini file: "specific_assets = a1 a2 a3"
  * We have a new hazard calculator, which can be invoked by setting in the
    job.ini file: "calculation_mode = classical_tiling"
    This calculators is the same as the classical calculator (i.e. you will
    get the same numbers) but instead of considering all the hazard sites at
    once, it splits them in tiles and compute the hazard curves for each tile
    sequentially. The intended usage is for very large calculations that
    exceed the available memory. It is especially convenient when you have
    very large logic trees and you are interested only in the statistics (i.e.
    mean curves and quantile curves). In that case you should use it with the
    option individual_curves=false. Notice that this calculator is still in
    an experimental stage and at the moment is does not support UHS curves.
    Hazard maps and hazard curves are supported.
  * We have a new risk calculator, which can be invoked by setting in the
    job.ini file: "calculation_mode = classical_damage"
    This calculator is able to compute the damage distribution for each asset
    starting from the hazard curves produced by the classical
    (or classical_tiling) calculator and a set of fragility functions. Also
    this calculator should be considered in experimental stage.
  * A significant change has been made when the parameter
    number_of_logic_tree_samples is set to a non-zero value. Now, if a branch
    of the source model logic tree is sampled twice we will generate the
    ruptures twice; before the ruptures were generated once and counted twice.
    For the classical calculator there is no effect on the numbers (sampling
    the same branch twice will produce two copies of identical ruptures);
    however, for the event based calculator, sampling the same branch twice
    will produce different ruptures. For instance, in the case of a simple
    source model with a single tectonic region type, before we would have
    generated a single file with the stochastic event sets, now we generate
    number_of_logic_tree_samples files with different stochastic event sets.
    The previous behavior was an optimization-induced bug.
  * Better validation of the input files (fragility models, job.ini)
  * The ability to extract the sites from the site_model.xml file
  * Several missing QA tests have been added
  * The export mechanism has been enhanced and more outputs are being exported
    in CSV format
  * New parameter complex_fault_mesh_spacing
  * Some error messages have been improved
  * A lot of functionality has been ported from the engine to oq-lite,
    i.e.  a lite version of the engine that does not depend on
    PostgreSQL/PostGIS/Django nor from RabbitMQ/Celery. This version is
    much easier to install than the regular engine and it is meant for
    small/medium computation that do not require a cluster. The engine
    demos, have been moved to the oq-risklib repository, so that they can
    be run via the oq-lite command without installing the full engine.
  * Currently the following calculators have been ported (all are to be
    intended as experimental): classical hazard, classical tiling, event
    based hazard, scenario hazard, classical risk, scenario damage,
    classical damage.
