Running the OpenQuake engine using the QGIS Plugin
==================================================

The employment of a methodology and workflow necessary for the evaluation of seismic risk that is integrated and 
holistic begins with the OpenQuake Integrated Risk Modelling Toolkit (OpenQuake IRMT). The OpenQuake IRMT is QGIS 
plugin that was developed by the `Global Earthquake Model (GEM) Foundation <http://www.globalquakemodel.org/>`_
and co-designed by GEM and the `Center for Disaster Management and Risk Reduction Technology (CEDIM) <https://www.cedim.de/english/index.php>`_. 
The plugin allows users to form an integrated workflow for the construction of metrics used to assess characteristics 
within societies that affect earthquake risk by providing a GIS-based platform for the construction of indicators and 
composite indices to foster comparative assessments.
