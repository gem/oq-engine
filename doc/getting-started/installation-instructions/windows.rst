Installing on Windows
=====================

The OpenQuake Engine can be installed on Windows with the :doc:`universal installer <universal>` script (recommended if you plan to develop GMPEs)
or with a traditional .exe installer which can be downloaded from
https://downloads.openquake.org/pkgs/windows/oq-engine/. 
The .exe installer includes Python 3.11 and all required dependencies and (since
version 3.19) does not require Windows administrator privileges.

Requirements
------------

Requirements are:

-  Windows 10 or 11 (64bit)
-  at least 16 GB of RAM (32GB recommended for Windows 11)
-  4 GB of free disk space

**Windows 7** and **Windows 8** are not supported.

We recommend using a Linux server for large calculations such as
national or regional-scale models.

Installation Procedure
----------------------

Download the installer from
https://downloads.openquake.org/pkgs/windows/oq-engine/ Double-click on
the installer to start the installation. Depend on your PC settings it is 
possible to  be presented with a popup message similar to the one shown below:

**IMPORTANT** even if you have installed the OpenQuake engine via the
universal installer, git or some other means, you must ensure that no
OpenQuake engine processes are running, that you do not have the User
Manual PDF or demo files open before proceeding. If any OpenQuake
processes are running or files are open, the installation may not
complete successfully.

If you do not have a previous installation of the OpenQuake Engine
installed, you can skip ahead to `Install OpenQuake Engine
Components <#install-components>`__

Press Next to continue. You will be presented with a reminder message:

all associated files, press OK to continue. The uninstaller will now

time to complete:
