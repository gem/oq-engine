Installation Procedure of Python 3
----------------------------------

Before using the universal installer you need to install Python3.

Downloading the Python version from the official Python website (python.org) is the recommended method for installing Python on a Mac.

Download the installer from  https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.11.8/python-3.11.8-macos11.pkg

The installation process is described in the following screenshots :

Localize the downloaded file on your computer (probably Downloads)

and double-click on the installer to start the installation.

IMPORTANT: Please note that the package includes its own private copy of OpenSSL 3.0.

The installer will walk you through a wizard to complete the installation, and in most cases, the default settings work well, so install it like the other applications on macOS. You may also have to enter your Mac password
