Training Website
================

In addition to the introductory material presented in this website, there is an online training 
website that is designed for an audience with a diverse background and expertise. Participants 
will learn the main concepts of earthquake risk assessment, along with the basic features of 
the engine.

The training activities have been tailored for beginner users, and are divided into four modules 
that cover different types of calculations using the OpenQuake engine.

Each module is approached from a technical and practical perspective. It includes a theoretical 
introduction, followed by step-by-step examples that help to consolidate the concepts, as well 
as exploring the OpenQuake engine tools for each type of calculation.

The OpenQuake engine online training initiative is part of the TREQ and FORCE project activities, led 
by the GEM Foundation and funded by the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID).
