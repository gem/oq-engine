* Improvements on the mosaic hazard calculations

** Doubled/tripled the precision of the ps_grid_spacing approximation

The =ps_grid_spacing= approximation ([[https://docs.openquake.org/oq-engine/advanced/point-source-gridding.html][described in the Advanced Manual]])
is a trick to speed up classical calculations dominated by point
sources at the cost of a minor loss in precision.

In engine 3.15 we improved a lot the precision without losing much in
performance. For instance, for the GLD model - chosen since it is the
smallest model in the mosaic and it can be run easily on a laptop -
the precision of engine 3.15 with =ps_grid_spacing=50= km is twice the
precision of engine 3.14.

The precision can be determined by comparing the uniform hazard spectra
between the full calculation and the approximated calculation:

$ oq compare uhs -1 -2  # v3.14
| poe     | rms-diff | max-diff | site  |
| 0.00211 | 0.00125  | 0.01944  | 7_302 |

$ oq compare uhs -1 -3  # v3.15
| poe     | rms-diff  | max-diff | site  |
| 0.00211 | 5.113E-04 | 0.01124  | 4_091 |

The =rms-diff= here is the root of the mean square differences between
hazard spectra on all hazard sites and IMTs, while the =max-diff= is
the difference between the hazard spectra at the site and IMT of
maximum discrepancy.

Thanks to the many performance improvements in engine 3.15, even if the
precision is a lot better, the performance is better than before in most
parts of the calculation:

The exception is =computing mean_std= which is slower because we chose
to reduce the size of the arrays with the benefit of using less memory
than before (from 39.8 GB to 33.7 GB).

Similar results hold for other models. For instance the precision
in the Canada 2015 model improves by a factor of 3 with a better overall
performance thanks to the improvements in =make_contexts=.

** The Canada 2015 model

In version 3.14 of the engine the tabular GMPEs were optimized by
moving the interpolation of IMT and magnitude in the controller node
and not in the worker nodes, i.e. outside an inner loop.
That allowed a substantial performance improvement in =computing mean_std=,
see the plot below.

Other operations became slightly slower having allocated larger memory
blocks to speedup as much as possible =computing mean_std=. This has been
fixed in version 3.15.
