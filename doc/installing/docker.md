To be able to deploy and run the OpenQuake Engine Docker container you need **at least** Docker version **1.10**. 

A basic knowledge about [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/) and how this kind of application containers work is also required.
For more information about operating system support (which includes Linux, macOS and specific versions of Windows) and on how to install Docker, please refer to the official [Docker website](https://www.docker.com/products/docker).

## Features provided

Each container includes:

- Python 3.8 from official docker image
- Python dependencies (numpy, scipy, h5py...)
- OpenQuake Engine and Hazardlib
- The `oq` command line tool
- The OpenQuake WebUI and API server (by default listening on port 8800)
- Single node and multi-node installation (with dynamic scaling)
