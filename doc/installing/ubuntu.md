# Installing the OpenQuake Engine on Ubuntu Linux

The OpenQuake Engine stable tree is available in the form of *deb* binary packages for the following Ubuntu releases:
- **Ubuntu 18.04** LTS (Bionic)
- **Ubuntu 16.04** LTS (Xenial)

Packages *may* work on Ubuntu derivatives (i.e. Mint Linux) and Debian, but this setup in not supported by GEM. See the **[FAQ](../faq.md#unsupported-operating-systems)**.

The software and its libraries will be installed under `/opt/openquake`. Data will be stored under `/var/lib/openquake`.

## Install packages from the OpenQuake repository

If you want to upgrade an existing installation see **[upgrading](../upgrading/ubuntu.md)**.

The following commands add the **official stable builds** package repository:
```
sudo add-apt-repository -y ppa:openquake/ppa
sudo apt update
```

If you want to install a **nightly build** please read the guide about installing the **[nightly build packages on Ubuntu](ubuntu-nightly.md)**.

Then to install the OpenQuake Engine and its libraries run
```bash
sudo apt install python3-oq-engine
```

## Configure the system services

The package installs three system service managed through [systemd](https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemctl.html):
- `openquake-dbserver`: provides the database for the OpenQuake Engine and must be started before running any `oq engine` command
- `openquake-webui`: provides the WebUI and is optional
- `openquake-celery`: used only on a multi-node setup, not used in a default setup

`openquake-dbserver` and `openquake-webui` are started by default at boot.

To manually start, stop or restart a service run
```bash
sudo systemctl <start|stop|restart> openquake-dbserver openquake-webui
```

To check the status of a service run
```bash
sudo systemctl status openquake-dbserver openquake-webui
```

## Run the OpenQuake Engine

Continue on [How to run the OpenQuake Engine](../running/unix.md)

## Test the installation

To run the OpenQuake Engine tests see the **[testing](../testing.md)** page.

## Uninstall the OpenQuake Engine

To uninstall the OpenQuake Engine and all its components run
```bash
sudo apt remove python-oq-* python3-oq-*
```
If you want to remove all the dependencies installed by the OpenQuake Engine you may then use the apt `autoremove` function and run

```bash
sudo apt autoremove
```

## Data cleanup

To reset the database `oq reset` command can be used:

```bash
sudo systemctl stop openquake-dbserver
sudo -u openquake oq reset
sudo systemctl start openquake-dbserver
```

To remove **all** the data produced by the OpenQuake Engine (including datastores) you must also remove `~/oqdata` in each users' home. The `reset-db` bash script is provided, as a reference, in `/usr/share/openquake/engine/utils`.

If the packages have been already uninstalled, it's safe to remove `/var/lib/openquake`.
