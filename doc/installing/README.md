# Installing the OpenQuake Engine

The OpenQuake Engine runs on Linux, macOS and Windows; on laptops,
workstations, standalone servers and multi-node clusters. Due to its
large range of use cases it can be installed in several different ways.

> **Warning**:
> If you already have an engine installation, before installing the new version you must [uninstall](universal.md#uninstalling-the-engine) the old one.

## Hardware requirements

The minimum required to install the engine and run the demos is

- 8 GB of RAM (16 GB on macOS Ventura)
- 4 GB of free disk space

To run any serious calculation (i.e. a model in GEM mosaic) you need
at least 2 GB of RAM per thread for hazard calculations and even more
memory for risk calculations. For instance, on a recent i9 processor
with 32 threads you would need at least 64 GB of RAM.

Check more advanced [hardware suggestions here](./hardware-suggestions.md).


## Installing the Long Term Support (LTS) version

**On Windows**

  Download OpenQuake Engine for Windows: https://downloads.openquake.org/pkgs/windows/oq-engine/OpenQuake_Engine_3.16.5-1.exe .
  Then follow the wizard on screen.
  > **Warning**:
  > Administrator level access may be required.


**On MacOS or Linux**

  See instructions for the [universal installer](./universal.md) script, and consider the specific LTS to be installed.


## Installing the latest version

See instructions for the [universal installer](./universal.md) script. This script works for Linux, macOS and Windows, on laptops, workstations, standalone servers and multi-node clusters.


## Changing the OpenQuake Engine version
  To change the version of the engine, make sure to uninstall the current version, before installing a new version.
  * [Uninstalling the engine](./universal.md#uninstalling-the-engine)
  * [Installing a specific engine version](./universal.md##installing-a-specific-engine-version)


## Other installation methods

**Using `pip`**

  The OpenQuake Engine is also available on **[PyPI](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/openquake.engine)** and can be installed in any Python 3 environment via `pip`:

    ```
    $ pip install -r https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gem/oq-engine/master/requirements-py38-linux64.txt openquake.engine
    ```
  This works for Linux and Python 3.8. You can trivially adapt the command to Python 3.9 and 3.10, and to other operating systems. For instance for Windows and Python 3.8, it would be

    ```
    $ pip install -r https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gem/oq-engine/master/requirements-py38-win64.txt openquake.engine
    ```
  and for Mac and Python 3.8, it would be
  
    ```
    $ pip install -r https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gem/oq-engine/master/requirements-py38-macos.txt openquake.engine
    ```

**Cloud**

  A set of [Docker containers](docker.md) for installing the engine in the cloud.
