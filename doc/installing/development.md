# Installing the OpenQuake Engine for development

To develop with the OpenQuake Engine and Hazardlib an installation
from sources must be performed. The easiest way it to use the
[universal installer](universal.md). The guide here is for people
wanting to do everything manually.

## Prerequisites

Knowledge of [Python](https://www.python.org/) (and its [virtual environments](https://docs.python.org/3.9/tutorial/venv.html)), [git](https://git-scm.com/) and [software development](https://xkcd.com/844/) are required.

Some software prerequisites are needed to build the development environment.
Python 3.8, 3.9 and 3.10 are supported.

### Ubuntu

```bash
sudo apt install git python3-venv
```

### RedHat 8 and clones

```bash
sudo dnf install python3
```

### macOS
*This procedure refers to the official Python distribution from [python.org](https://python.org). If you are using a different python (from brew, macports, conda) you may need to adapt the following commands.*

#### Xcode

You must install the Command Line Tools Package for Xcode first. You can install the Command Line Tools package without having to install the entire Xcode software by running:

```bash
xcode-select --install
```

If Xcode is already installed on your machine, then there is no need to install the command-line tools.

#### Encoding

Make sure that the encoding set in the terminal is `en_US.UTF-8`. To force it, you should put the following lines in your `~/.profile`:

```bash
export LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8
export LANG=en_US.UTF-8
```

### Download the OpenQuake source code
Considering that the complete repository is quite large given its long history, we recommend shallow cloning the repository to download only the latest revision.

```bash
mkdir src && cd src
git clone https://github.com/gem/oq-engine.git --depth=1
```

In case you needed the source code with the full history of the repository, you
can convert the shallow clone into a full repository with the command
`git fetch --unshallow`.

### Install OpenQuake in development mode

```bash
$ cd oq-engine && python3 install.py devel
```

## Loading and unloading the development environment

To exit from the OpenQuake development environment type `deactivate`. Before using again the OpenQuake software the environment must be reloaded running `source openquake/bin/activate`(assuming that it has been installed under 'openquake'). For more information about *virtualenv*, see http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/dev/virtualenvs/.

To load the virtual environment automatically at every login, add the following line at the bottom of your `~/.bashrc` (Linux) or `~/.profile` (macOS):

```bash
source $HOME/openquake/bin/activate
```

You can also add a short-hand command to enable it:

```bash
alias oqenv="source $HOME/openquake/bin/activate"
```

Put it again at the bottom of `~/.bashrc` or `~/.profile`; close and re-open the terminal. You can now load your environment just typing `oqenv`.

It is also possible to run the `oq` command without the corresponding virtual environment loaded. Just run `$HOME/openquake/bin/oq`; for convenience you can also add it as an `alias` in your `~/.bashrc` (Linux) or `~/.profile` (macOS):

```bash
alias oq="$HOME/openquake/bin/oq"
```

### Multiple installations

If any other installation of the Engine exists on the same machine, like a system-wide installation made with packages, you must change the DbServer port from the default one (1908) to any other unused port. Using a DbServer started from a different codebase (which may be out-of-sync) could lead to unexpected behaviours and errors. To change the DbServer port `oq-engine/openquake/engine/openquake.cfg` must be updated:

```
[dbserver]          |  [dbserver]
## cut ##           |  ## cut ##
port = 1908         >  port = 1985
authkey = changeme  |  authkey = changeme
## cut ##           |  ## cut ##
```

## Running the tests

To run the OpenQuake Engine tests see the **[testing](../testing.md)** page.

### Sync the source code with remote

You can pull all the latest changes to the source code running

```bash
cd oq-engine
oq dbserver stop
git pull
```

## Uninstall the OpenQuake Engine

To uninstall the OpenQuake development make sure that its environment is not loaded, typing `deactivate`, and then remove the folder where it has been installed: `rm -Rf $HOME/openquake`.

## Install third party software

It is possible to install, as an example, the [Silx HDF5 viewer](http://www.silx.org/) in the same environment as the OpenQuake Engine. To make that happen run the following commands via the `oq-console.bat` prompt:

```bash
pip install PyQt5 silx
```

Silx viewer can be then run as

```bash
silx view calc_NNN.hdf5
```

***

### Notes ###

If your system does not support the provided binary dependencies (python wheels)

```bash
pip install -e oq-engine
```

will try to download the required dependencies from [pypi](http://pypi.python.org/). This may require some extra work to get all the external C dependencies resolved. Also, there is not guarantee that the engine wil work, since newer versions of the libraries could be incompatible.
If you are using a non-standard python distribution (like _macports_ or _anaconda_) you should use tools provided by such distribution to get the required dependencies.
