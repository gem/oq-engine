# Upgrading the OpenQuake Engine on RedHat Linux 7 and its clones

To upgrade the OpenQuake Engine and its libraries run

```bash
sudo yum upgrade python-oq-*
```

If a custom configuration is installed in `/etc/openquake/engine/openquake.cfg` this configuration will be left untouched and the new configuration file, provided by the upgrade, will be installed as `/etc/openquake/engine/openquake.cfg.rpmnew`. Before starting using OpenQuake you must check for new configuration parameters or changes in the `openquake.cfg.rpmnew` file and merge those into your `openquake.cfg`. This can be done manually with `diff` or using `rpmconf` (see `man rpmconf`).

### Coming from OpenQuake Engine 1.x

The following dependencies are not used anymore by the OpenQuake Engine 2:
- postgresql-server and postgis
- other minor dependencies

They can be removed, if not used by any other software installed on your machine, by running

```
sudo yum erase --remove-leaves postgresql-server postgis python-psycopg2
```

To be able to use the `--remove-leaves` feature you need a `yum` plugin called `yum-plugin-remove-with-leaves`. If it's unavailable on your system, it can be installed via `yum`

```
sudo yum install yum-plugin-remove-with-leaves
```
