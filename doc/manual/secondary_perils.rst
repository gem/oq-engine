Secondary Perils Analysis
=========================

Landslides and liquefaction are well-known perils that accompany earthquakes. Basic models to describe their occurrence have been around for decades and are constantly improving. However, these models have rarely been incorporated into PSHA.

The tools presented here are implementations of some of the more common and appropriate secondary perils models. The intention is seamless incorporation of these models into PSH(R)A calculations done through the OpenQuake Engine, though the incorporation is a work in progress.

Tools for preparing the data for these models are also presented. This can be a non-trivial challenge, and consistent and correct data preparation is necessary for accurate secondary peril hazard and risk calculations.
