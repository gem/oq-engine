In this section we describe the structure of the configuration file to be used
to complete a seismic hazard disaggregation. Since only a few parts of the
standard configuration file need to be changed we can use the description
given in Section~\ref{subsec:config_classical_psha} at
page~\pageref{subsec:config_classical_psha} as a reference and we emphasize
herein major differences.

\begin{minted}[firstline=1,linenos=true,firstnumber=1,fontsize=\footnotesize,frame=single,bgcolor=lightgray]{ini}
[general]
description = A demo .ini file for PSHA disaggregation
calculation_mode = disaggregation
random_seed = 1024
\end{minted}

The calculation mode parameter in this case is set as
\texttt{disaggregation}.

\textbf{Geometry of the area (or the sites) where hazard is computed}

\begin{minted}[firstline=1,linenos=true,firstnumber=5,fontsize=\footnotesize,frame=single,bgcolor=lightgray]{ini}
[geometry]
sites = 11.0 44.5
\end{minted}

In the section it is necessary to specify the geographic coordinates of
the site(s) where the disaggregation will be performed. The coordinates
of multiple site should be separated with a comma.

\textbf{Disaggregation parameters}

The disaggregation parameters need to be added to the the standard
configuration file. They are shown in the following example and a description
of each parameter is provided below.

\begin{minted}[firstline=1,linenos=true,firstnumber=7,fontsize=\footnotesize,frame=single,bgcolor=lightgray]{ini}
[disaggregation]
poes_disagg = 0.02, 0.1
mag_bin_width = 1.0
distance_bin_width = 25.0
coordinate_bin_width = 1.5
num_epsilon_bins = 3
disagg_outputs = Mag_Dist_Eps Mag_Lon_Lat
num_rlzs_disagg = 3
\end{minted}

\begin{itemize}

    \item \Verb+poes_disagg+: disaggregation is performed for the intensity
    measure levels corresponding to the probability of exceedance value(s) provided
    here. The computations use the \texttt{investigation\_time} and the
    \texttt{intensity\_measure\_types\_and\_levels} defined in the
    ``Calculation configuration'' section   (see page~\pageref{sec:calculation_configuration}).
    For the \texttt{poes\_disagg} the intensity measure level(s) for the disaggregation are
    inferred by performing a classical calculation and by inverting the hazard curves.

    \item \Verb+iml_disagg+: the intensity measure level(s) to be disaggregated
	    can be directly defined by specifying \texttt{iml\_disagg}. Note
		that a disaggregation computation requires either
		\texttt{poes\_disagg} or \texttt{iml\_disagg} to be defined, but
		both cannot be defined at the same time.

    \item \Verb+mag_bin_width+: mandatory; specifies the width of every
	    magnitude histogram bin of the disaggregation matrix computed

    \item \Verb+distance_bin_width+: specifies the width of every distance
	    histogram bin of the disaggregation matrix computed (km)

    \item \Verb+coordinate_bin_width+: specifies the width of every
	    longitude-latitude histogram bin of the disaggregation matrix
		computed (decimal degrees)

    \item \Verb+num_epsilon_bins+: mandatory; specifies the number of epsilon
	    histogram bins of the disaggregation matrix. The width of the
		epsilon bins depends on the \texttt{truncation\_level} defined
		in the ``Calculation configuration'' section
		(page~\pageref{sec:calculation_configuration})

    \item \Verb+disagg_outputs+: optional; specifies the type(s) of
	    disaggregation to be computed. The options are: \texttt{Mag},
		\texttt{Dist}, \texttt{Lon\_Lat}, \texttt{Lon\_Lat\_TRT},
		\texttt{Mag\_Dist}, \texttt{Mag\_Dist\_Eps},
		\texttt{Mag\_Lon\_Lat}, \texttt{TRT}. If none are specified,
		then all are computed. More details of the disaggregation output
		are given in the ``Outputs from Hazard Disaggregation'' section,
		see page~\pageref{subsec:output_hazard_disaggregation})

    \item \Verb+disagg_by_src+: optional; if specified and set to true,
	    disaggregation by source is computed, if possible.

    \item \Verb+num_rlzs_disagg+: optional; specifies the number of realizations
	    to be used, selecting those that yield intensity measure levels
		closest to the mean.  

\end{itemize}

Alternatively to \texttt{num\_rlzs\_disagg}, the user can specify the index or
indices of the realizations to disaggregate as a list of comma-separated
integers. For example:

\begin{minted}[firstline=1,linenos=true,firstnumber=7,fontsize=\footnotesize,frame=single,bgcolor=lightgray]{ini}
[disaggregation]
rlz_index = 22,23
\end{minted}

If \texttt{num\_rlzs\_disagg} is specified, the user cannot specify
\texttt{rlz\_index}, and vice versa. If neither is specified, the
realization that yields the intensity measure level closest to the mean will be
selected. The mean disaggregation is based on only the selected realizations,
$not$ all the realizations of the model.  

As mentioned above, the user also has the option to perform disaggregation by
directly specifying the intensity measure level to be disaggregated, rather than
specifying the probability of exceedance. An example is shown below:

\begin{minted}[firstline=1,linenos=true,firstnumber=7,fontsize=\footnotesize,frame=single,bgcolor=lightgray]{ini}
[disaggregation]
iml_disagg = {'PGA': 0.1}
\end{minted}

If \texttt{iml\_disagg} is specified, the user should not include
\texttt{intensity\_measure\_types\_and\_levels} in the ``Calculation
configuration'' section (see page~\pageref{sec:calculation_configuration}) since
it is explicitly given here.
