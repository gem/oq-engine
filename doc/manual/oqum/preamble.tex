The goal of this manual is to provide a comprehensive and transparent
description of the features of the \glsdesc{acr:oqe21}. This manual is
designed to be readable by someone with basic understanding of Probabilistic
Seismic Hazard and Risk Analysis, but no previous knowledge of the
\glsdesc{acr:oqe} is assumed.

The \glsdesc{acr:oqe} is an effort promoted and actively developed by the
\glsdesc{acr:gem}, a public-private partnership initiated by the
Global Science Forum of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development
(OECD)\footnote{A short description of the process promoted by OECD is available here:\\\href{http://www.oecd.org/science/sci-tech/theglobalearthquakemodelgem.htm}{http://www.oecd.org/science/sci-tech/theglobalearthquakemodelgem.htm}}.

The \glsdesc{acr:oqe} is the result of an effort carried out jointly by the
Information Technology and Scientific teams working at the \gls{acr:gem} Secretariat.
