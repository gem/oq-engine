The seismic risk results are calculated using the \gls{acr:risklib}, 
an open-source suite of tools for seismic risk assessment and
loss estimation. This library is written in the Python programming language
and available in the form of a ``developers'' release at the following location:
\href{https://github.com/gem/oq-engine/tree/master/openquake/risklib}{https://github.com/gem/oq-engine/tree/master/openquake/risklib}.

The risk component of the \glsdesc{acr:oqe} can compute both scenario-based and
probabilistic seismic damage and risk using various approaches. The following
types of analysis are currently supported:

\begin{itemize}

    \item \textit{\textbf{Scenario Damage Assessment}}, for the
	calculation of damage distribution statistics for a portfolio of buildings
	from a single earthquake rupture scenario taking into account aleatory and
	epistemic ground-motion variability.

    \item \textit{\textbf{Scenario Risk Assessment}}, for the calculation of
	individual asset and portfolio loss statistics due to a single earthquake
	rupture scenario taking into account aleatory and epistemic ground-motion
	variability. Correlation in the vulnerability of different assets of the
	same typology can also be taken into consideration.

	\item \textit{\textbf{Classical Probabilistic Seismic Damage Analysis}}, for 
	the calculation of damage state probabilities over a specified time period,  
	and probabilistic collapse maps, starting from the hazard curves 
	computed following the classical integration procedure (\cite{cornell1968}, 
	\citet{mcguire1976}) as formulated by \cite{field2003}.

    \item \textit{\textbf{Classical Probabilistic Seismic Risk Analysis}}, for the
	calculation of loss curves and loss maps, starting from the hazard curves 
	computed following the classical integration procedure (\cite{cornell1968}, 
	\citet{mcguire1976}) as formulated by \cite{field2003}.

	\item \textit{\textbf{Stochastic Event Based Probabilistic Seismic Risk Analysis}}, 
	for the calculation of event loss tables starting from stochastic event sets.
	Other results such as loss-exceedance curves, probabilistic loss maps, 
	average annual losses, and insured loss statistics can be obtained by 
	post-processing the event loss tables.

    \item \textit{\textbf{Retrofit Benefit-Cost Ratio Analysis}}, which is
	useful in estimating the net-present value of the potential benefits of
	performing retrofitting for a portfolio of assets (in terms of decreased
	losses in seismic events), measured relative to the upfront cost of
	retrofitting.

\end{itemize}

Each calculation workflow has a modular structure, so that intermediate
results can be saved and analyzed. Moreover, each calculator can be
extended independently of the others so that additional calculation options
and methodologies can be easily introduced, without affecting the overall
calculation workflow. Each workflow is described in more detail in the
following sections.
