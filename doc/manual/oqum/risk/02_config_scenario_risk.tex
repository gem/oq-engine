In order to run this calculator, the parameter \Verb+calculation_mode+ needs
to be set to \Verb+scenario_risk+. 

Most of the job configuration parameters required for running a scenario risk
calculation are the same as those described in the previous section for the
scenario damage calculator. The remaining parameters specific to the scenario
risk calculator are illustrated through the examples below.


\paragraph{Example 1}

This example illustrates a scenario risk calculation which uses a single
configuration file to first compute the ground motion fields for the given
rupture model and then calculate loss statistics for structural losses
and nonstructural losses, based on the ground
motion fields. The job configuration file required for running this scenario
risk calculation is shown in Listing~\ref{lst:config_scenario_risk_combined}.

\end{listing}

Whereas a scenario damage calculation requires one or more fragility and/or
consequence models, a scenario risk calculation requires the user to specify
one or more vulnerability model files. Note that one or more of the following
parameters can be used in the same job configuration file to provide the
corresponding vulnerability model files:

\begin{itemize}

  \item \Verb+structural_vulnerability_file+: this parameter is used to
    specify the path to the structural \gls{vulnerabilitymodel} file

  \item \Verb+nonstructural_vulnerability_file+: this parameter is used to
    specify the path to the nonstructural\gls{vulnerabilitymodel} file

  \item \Verb+contents_vulnerability_file+: this parameter is used to
    specify the path to the contents \gls{vulnerabilitymodel} file

  \item \Verb+business_interruption_vulnerability_file+: this parameter is
    used to specify the path to the business interruption
    \gls{vulnerabilitymodel} file

  \item \Verb+occupants_vulnerability_file+: this parameter is used to
    specify the path to the occupants \gls{vulnerabilitymodel} file

\end{itemize}

It is important that the \Verb+lossCategory+ parameter in the metadata section
for each provided vulnerability model file (``structural'', ``nonstructural'',
``contents'', ``business\_interruption'', or ``occupants'') should match the
loss type defined in the configuration file by the relevant keyword above.

The remaining new parameters introduced in this example are the following:

\begin{itemize}

  \item \Verb+master_seed+: this parameter is used to control the random
    number generator in the loss ratio sampling process. If the same
    \Verb+master_seed+ is defined at each calculation run, the same random loss
    ratios will be generated, thus allowing reproducibility of the results.

  \item \Verb+asset_correlation+: if the uncertainty in the loss ratios
    has been defined within the \gls{vulnerabilitymodel}, users can specify
    a coefficient of correlation that will be used in the Monte Carlo sampling
    process of the loss ratios, between the assets that share the same
    \gls{taxonomy}. If the \Verb+asset_correlation+ is set to one,
    the loss ratio residuals will be perfectly correlated. On the other hand,
    if this parameter is set to zero, the loss ratios will be sampled
    independently. If this parameter is not defined, the
    \glsdesc{acr:oqe} will assume zero correlation in the vulnerability. As of
    \glsdesc{acr:oqe18}, \Verb+asset_correlation+ applies only to continuous
    \glspl{vulnerabilityfunction} using the lognormal or Beta distribution; 
    it does not apply to \glspl{vulnerabilityfunction} defined using the PMF
    distribution. Although partial correlation was supported in previous
    versions of the engine, beginning from \glsdesc{acr:oqe22}, values between
    zero and one are no longer supported due to performance considerations. The
    only two values permitted are \Verb+asset_correlation = 0+ and 
    \Verb+asset_correlation = 1+.

\end{itemize}

In this case, the ground motion fields will be computed at each of the
locations of the assets in the exposure model and for each of the intensity
measure types found in the provided set of vulnerability models. The above
calculation can be run using the command line:

\begin{minted}[fontsize=\footnotesize,frame=single,bgcolor=lightgray]{shell-session}
user@ubuntu:~\$ oq engine --run job.ini
\end{minted}

After the calculation is completed, a message similar to the following will be
displayed:

\begin{minted}[fontsize=\footnotesize,frame=single,bgcolor=lightgray]{shell-session}
Calculation 2735 completed in 10 seconds. Results:
  id | name
5328 | Aggregate Asset Losses
5329 | Average Asset Losses
5330 | Aggregate Event Losses
\end{minted}

All of the different ways of running a scenario damage calculation as
illustrated through the examples of the previous section are also applicable
to the scenario risk calculator, though the examples are not repeated here.


A few additional parameters related to the event based risk calculator that
may be useful for controlling specific aspects of the calculation are listed
below:

\begin{itemize}

  \item \Verb+ignore_covs+: this parameter controls the propagation of 
    vulnerability uncertainty to losses. The vulnerability functions using 
    continuous distributions (such as the lognormal distribution or beta 
    distribution) to characterize the uncertainty in the loss ratio 
    conditional on the shaking intensity level, specify the mean loss ratios 
    and the corresponding coefficients of variation for a set of intensity 
    levels. They are used to build the so called epsilon matrix within the 
    engine, which is how loss ratios are sampled from the distribution for 
    each asset. There is clearly a performance penalty associated with the 
    propagation of uncertainty in the vulnerability to losses. The epsilon 
    matrix has to be computed and stored, and then the worker processes have 
    to read it, which involves large quantities of data transfer and memory 
    usage. Setting \Verb+ignore_covs = true+ in the job file will result in 
    the engine using just the mean loss ratio conditioned on the shaking 
    intensity and ignoring the uncertainty. This tradeoff of not propagating 
    the vulnerabilty uncertainty to the loss estimates can lead to a 
    significant boost in performance and tractability. The default value of 
    \Verb+ignore_covs+ is \Verb+false+. 

\end{itemize}
