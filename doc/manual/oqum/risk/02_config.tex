This Chapter summarises the structure of the information necessary to define
the different input data to be used with the \glsdesc{acr:oqe} risk
calculators. Input data for scenario-based and probabilistic seismic damage
and risk analysis using the \glsdesc{acr:oqe} are organised into:

\begin{itemize}

  \item An exposure model file in the NRML format, as described in 
    Section~\ref{sec:exposure}.

  \item A file describing the \gls{vulnerabilitymodel}
    (Section~\ref{sec:vulnerability}) for loss calculations, or a 
  	file describing the \gls{fragilitymodel} (Section~\ref{sec:fragility})
    for damage calculations. Optionally, a file describing the
    \gls{consequencemodel} (Section~\ref{sec:consequence}) can also be
  	provided in order to calculate losses from the estimated damage
  	distributions.

  \item A general calculation configuration file.

  \item Hazard inputs. These include hazard curves for the classical
    probabilistic damage and risk calculators, ground motion fields for the
    scenario damage and risk calculators, or stochastic event sets for the
    probabilistic event based calculators. As of \glsdesc{acr:oqe21}, in
    general, there are five different ways in which hazard calculation
    parameters or results can be provided to the \glsdesc{acr:oqe} in order to
    run the subsequent risk calculations:

    \begin{itemize}

      \item Use a single configuration file for running the hazard and risk
      calculations sequentially (preferred)

      \item Use separate configuration files for running the hazard and risk
      calculations sequentially (legacy)

      \item Use a configuration file for the risk calculation along with all
      hazard outputs from a previously completed, compatible
      \glsdesc{acr:oqe} hazard calculation

      % \item Use a configuration file for the risk calculation along with a
      % specific hazard output from a previously completed, compatible
      % \glsdesc{acr:oqe} hazard calculation

      \item Use a configuration file for the risk calculation along with
      hazard input files in the OpenQuake NRML format

    \end{itemize}

\end{itemize}

The file formats for \glspl{exposuremodel}, \glspl{fragilitymodel},
\glspl{consequencemodel}, and \glspl{vulnerabilitymodel} have been described
earlier in Chapter~\ref{chap:riskinputs}. The configuration file is the primary
file that provides the \glsdesc{acr:oqe} information regarding both the
definition of the input models (e.g. exposure, site parameters, fragility,
consequence, or vulnerability models) as well as the parameters governing the
risk calculation.

Information regarding the configuration file for running hazard calculations
using the \glsdesc{acr:oqe} can be found in
Section~\ref{sec:hazard_configuration_file}. Some initial mandatory parameters
of the configuration file common to all of the risk calculators are presented
in Listing~\ref{lst:config_example}. The remaining parameters that are
specific to each risk calculator are discussed in subsequent sections.

  \label{lst:config_example}
\end{listing}

\begin{itemize}

  \item \Verb+description+: a parameter that can be used to include some
  information about the type of calculations that are going to be performed.

  \item \Verb+calculation_mode+: this parameter specifies the type of
  calculation to be run. Valid options for the \Verb+calculation_mode+ for
  the risk calculators are: \Verb+scenario_damage+, \Verb+scenario_risk+,
  \Verb+classical_damage+, \Verb+classical_risk+, \Verb+event_based_risk+,
  and \Verb+classical_bcr+.

  \item \Verb+exposure_file+: this parameter is used to specify the path to
  the \gls{exposuremodel} file. Typically this is the path to the xml file
  containing the exposure, or the xml file containing the metadata sections
  for the case where the assets are listed in one or more csv files. 
  For particularly large exposure models, it may be more convenient to provide 
  the path to a single compressed zip file that contains the exposure xml file
  and the exposure csv files (if any).

\end{itemize}

Depending on the type of risk calculation, other parameters besides the
aforementioned ones may need to be provided. We illustrate in the following
sections different examples of the configuration file for the different risk
calculators.
