The following sections describe the set of demos that have been compiled to
demonstrate some of the features and usage of the risk calculators of the
\glsdesc{acr:oqe}. These demos can be found in a public repository on GitHub at
the following link:
\href{https://github.com/gem/oq-engine/tree/master/demos/risk}
{https://github.com/gem/oq-engine/tree/master/demos/risk}.
Furthermore, a folder containing all of these
demonstrative examples is provided when an OATS (OpenQuake Alpha Testing
Service) account is requested, and it is also part of the \gls{acr:oqe}
virtual image package.

These examples are purely demonstrative and are not intended to represent
accurately the seismicity, vulnerability or exposure characteristics of the
region of interest, but simply to provide example input files that can be used
as a starting point for users planning to employ the \glsdesc{acr:oqe} in seismic
risk and loss estimation studies.

It is also noted that in the demonstrative examples presented in this section,
illustrations about the various messages from the engine displayed in the
command line interface are presented. These messages often contain information
about the calculation id and output id, which will certainly be different for
each user.

Following is the list of demos which illustrate how to use the \gls{acr:oqe} for
various scenario-based and probabilistic seismic risk analyses:

\begin{itemize}

    \item ClassicalBCR
	\item ClassicalDamage
    \item ClassicalRisk
    \item EventBasedRisk
    \item ScenarioDamage
    \item ScenarioRisk

\end{itemize}

These six demos use Nepal as the region of interest. An example
\gls{exposuremodel} has been developed for this region, comprising 9,144
assets distributed amongst 2,221 locations (due to the existence of more than
one \gls{asset} at the same location). A map with the distribution of the
number of buildings throughout Nepal is presented in Figure~\ref{fig:exposure-nepal}.

\begin{figure}[ht]

\caption{Distribution of number of buildings in Nepal}
\label{fig:exposure-nepal}
\end{figure}

The building portfolio was organised into four classes for the rural areas
(adobe, dressed stone, unreinforced fired brick, wooden frames), and five
classes for the urban areas (the aforementioned typologies, in addition to
reinforced concrete buildings). For each one of these building typologies,
\glspl{vulnerabilityfunction} and \glspl{fragilityfunction} were collected
from the published literature available for the region. These input models are
only for demonstrative purposes and for further information about the building
characteristics of Nepal, users are advised to contact the National Society
for Earthquake Technology of Nepal (NSET -
\href{http://www.nset.org.np/}{http:www.nset.org.np/}).

The following sections include instructions not only on how to run the risk
calculations, but also on how to produce the necessary hazard inputs. Thus,
each demo comprises the configuration file, \gls{exposuremodel} and fragility or
vulnerability models fundamental for the risk calculations. Each demo folder
also a configuration file and the input models to produce the relevant hazard
inputs.
