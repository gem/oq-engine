Contributing
============

This section contains information for developers who want to contribute to the
development of the OpenQuake engine. We provide an overview of the architecture
of the engine, and a general guide to developing with the engine. We also provide
information on how to implement a new ground shaking intensity model (GSIM). Finally,
we provide information on how to update the changelog.
