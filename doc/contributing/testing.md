# Continuous integration and testing for OpenQuake

## Automatic testing

The OpenQuake code is automatically tested by Continuous integration systems (GitHub and GitLab Actions), at every merge and every night.

## Manual testing

The full suite of tests for the OpenQuake Engine can be run using `pytest` from [**source code**](../getting-started/installation-instructions/development.md):

```bash
$ oq dbserver upgrade
$ pytest -v openquake
```

Python packages can also be specified to run only a subset of tests. Some examples are:

```bash
# Hazardlib
$ pytest -vs openquake/hazardlib

# Calculators
$ oq dbserver start
$ pytest -vs openquake/calculators

# Engine server
$ oq dbserver start
$ pytest -vs openquake/server
```

See the `pytest` [documentation](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/contents.html) for further information and command options.
