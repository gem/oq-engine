The OpenQuake Engine software provides calculation and assessment of seismic hazard, risk and decision-making tools via the data, methods and standards that are being developed by **[GEM](http://www.globalquakemodel.org)** (Global Earthquake Model) and its collaborators.

The seismic hazard calculations of the OpenQuake Engine are powered by the **[OpenQuake Hazard Library](http://github.com/gem/oq-hazardlib)** and
 **OpenQuake Risk Library**
Both libraries were built by the OpenQuake team to serve as a fast, stable, and lightweight alternative to existing risk and hazard libraries.

To get involved in OpenQuake, join us on IRC (irc.freenode.net) in the #openquake channel by using an IRC client or via web at http://webchat.freenode.net. You can also submit questions, comments, or support requests to our developer mailing list: http://groups.google.com/group/openquake-dev.
