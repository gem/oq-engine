How the hazard sites are determined
===================================

There are several ways to specify the hazard sites in an engine calculation.

1. The user can specify the sites directly in the job.ini using the ``sites``
   parameter (e.g. ``sites = -122.4194 37.7749, -118.2437 34.0522, -117.1611 32.7157``).
   This method is perhaps most useful when the analysis is limited to a 
   handful of sites.
2. Otherwise the user can specify the list of sites in a CSV file
   (i.e. ``sites_csv = sites.csv``).
3. Otherwise the user can specify a grid via the ``region`` and
   ``region_grid_spacing`` parameters.
4. Otherwise the sites can be inferred from the exposure, if any,
   in two different ways:
   
   1.    if ``region_grid_spacing`` is specified, a grid is implicitly
         generated from the convex hull of the exposure and used
   2.    otherwise the locations of the assets are used as hazard sites
   
5. Otherwise the sites can be inferred from the site model file, if any.

It must be noted that the engine rounds longitudes and latitudes	
to 5 decimal places (or approximately 1 meter spatial resolution),
so sites that differ only at the 6th decimal place or beyond will
end up being considered as duplicated sites by the engine, and 
this will be flagged as an error.

Having determined the sites, a ``SiteCollection`` object is generated
by associating the closest parameters from the site model (if any)
or using the global site parameters, if any.
If the site model is specified, but the closest site parameters are 
too distant from the sites, a warning is logged for each site.

There are a number of error situations:

1. If both site model and global site parameters are missing, the engine
   raises an error.
2. If both site model and global site parameters are specified, the
   engine raises an error.
3. Specifying both the sites.csv and a grid is an error.
4. Specifying both the sites.csv and a site_model.csv is an error.
   If you are in such situation you should consider using the command
   ``oq prepare_site_model``
   to manually prepare a site model on the location of the sites.
5. Having duplicates (i.e. rows with identical lon, lat) in the site model	
   is an error.   

The relation between asset locations and hazard sites
=====================================================

This is one of the most frequently asked questions in the mailing list.
The answer is long and difficult and depends very much on the version
of the engine, since there are several corner cases and tricky points.
