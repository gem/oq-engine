Logic Trees
==========================

Logic trees are documented in the OpenQuake manual (section "Defining
Logic Trees"). However some features are only mentioned without giving
examples (such as ``applyToBranches``) and some recent developments
are missing, in particular the ``extendModel`` feature. Here we
will document both.

extendModel
---------------------------------

Starting from engine 3.9 it is possible to define logic trees by adding sources
to one or more base models. An example will make things clear:

.. code-block:: xml

  <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
  <nrml xmlns:gml="http://www.opengis.net/gml"
        xmlns="http://openquake.org/xmlns/nrml/0.5">
    <logicTree logicTreeID="lt1">
      <logicTreeBranchSet uncertaintyType="sourceModel"
                          branchSetID="bs0">
        <logicTreeBranch branchID="A">
          <uncertaintyModel>common1.xml</uncertaintyModel>
          <uncertaintyWeight>0.6</uncertaintyWeight>
        </logicTreeBranch>
        <logicTreeBranch branchID="B">
          <uncertaintyModel>common2.xml</uncertaintyModel>
          <uncertaintyWeight>0.4</uncertaintyWeight>
        </logicTreeBranch>
      </logicTreeBranchSet>
      <logicTreeBranchSet uncertaintyType="extendModel" branchSetID="bs1">
        <logicTreeBranch branchID="C">
          <uncertaintyModel>extra1.xml</uncertaintyModel>
          <uncertaintyWeight>0.6</uncertaintyWeight>
        </logicTreeBranch>
        <logicTreeBranch branchID="D">
          <uncertaintyModel>extra2.xml</uncertaintyModel>
          <uncertaintyWeight>0.2</uncertaintyWeight>
        </logicTreeBranch>
        <logicTreeBranch branchID="E">
          <uncertaintyModel>extra3.xml</uncertaintyModel>
          <uncertaintyWeight>0.2</uncertaintyWeight>
        </logicTreeBranch>
      </logicTreeBranchSet>
    </logicTree>
  </nrml>

In this example there are two base source models, named
``commom1.xml`` and ``common2.xml`` and three possibile extensions
``extra1.xml``, ``extra2.xml`` and ``extra3.xml``. The engine will
generate six effective source models by extending first
``common1.xml`` and then ``common2.xml`` with ``extra1.xml``, then
with ``extra2.xml`` and then with ``extra3.xml`` respectively. Notice
that ``extra1.xml``, ``extra2.xml`` and ``extra3.xml`` can be different
versions of the same sources with different parameters or geometries,
so ``extendModel`` can be used to implement correlated uncertainties.

Since engine 3.15 it is possible to describe logic trees as python
lists (one list for each branchset) and to programmatically generate
the realizations by using a simplified logic tree implementation in
hazardlib. This is extremely useful. For instance, the logic tree
above would be written as follows:

.. code-block:: python

 >>> from openquake.hazardlib.lt import build
 >>> logictree = build(
 ...     ['sourceModel', [], ['A', 'common1.xml', 0.6],
 ...                         ['B', 'common2.xml', 0.4]],
 ...     ['extendModel', [], ['C', 'extra1.xml', 0.6],
 ...                         ['D', 'extra2.xml', 0.2],
 ...                         ['E', 'extra3.xml', 0.2]])

and the 6 possible paths can be extracted as follows:
 
 >>> logictree.get_all_paths()  # 2 x 3 paths
 ['AC', 'AD', 'AE', 'BC', 'BD', 'BE']

The empty square brackets means that the branchset should be applied to all
branches in the previous branchset and correspond to the ``applyToBranches``
tag in the XML version of the logic tree. If ``applyToBranches`` is missing,
the logic tree is multiplicative and the total number of paths can be
obtained simply by multiplying the number of paths in each branchset.
When ``applyToBranches`` is used, the logic tree becomes additive and the
total number of paths can be obtained by summing the number of paths in
the different subtrees. For instance, let us extend the previous example
by adding another ``extendModel`` branchset and by using ``applyToBranches``:

.. code-block:: xml

  <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
  <nrml xmlns:gml="http://www.opengis.net/gml"
        xmlns="http://openquake.org/xmlns/nrml/0.4">
    <logicTree logicTreeID="lt1">
      <logicTreeBranchSet uncertaintyType="sourceModel"
                          branchSetID="bs0">
        <logicTreeBranch branchID="A">
          <uncertaintyModel>common1.xml</uncertaintyModel>
          <uncertaintyWeight>0.6</uncertaintyWeight>
        </logicTreeBranch>
        <logicTreeBranch branchID="B">
          <uncertaintyModel>common2.xml</uncertaintyModel>
          <uncertaintyWeight>0.4</uncertaintyWeight>
        </logicTreeBranch>
      </logicTreeBranchSet>
      <logicTreeBranchSet uncertaintyType="extendModel" branchSetID="bs1"
                          applyToBranches="A">
        <logicTreeBranch branchID="C">
          <uncertaintyModel>extra1.xml</uncertaintyModel>
          <uncertaintyWeight>0.6</uncertaintyWeight>
        </logicTreeBranch>
        <logicTreeBranch branchID="D">
          <uncertaintyModel>extra2.xml</uncertaintyModel>
          <uncertaintyWeight>0.2</uncertaintyWeight>
        </logicTreeBranch>
        <logicTreeBranch branchID="E">
          <uncertaintyModel>extra3.xml</uncertaintyModel>
          <uncertaintyWeight>0.2</uncertaintyWeight>
        </logicTreeBranch>
      </logicTreeBranchSet>
      <logicTreeBranchSet uncertaintyType="extendModel" branchSetID="bs2"
                          applyToBranches="B">
        <logicTreeBranch branchID="F">
          <uncertaintyModel>extra4.xml</uncertaintyModel>
          <uncertaintyWeight>0.6</uncertaintyWeight>
        </logicTreeBranch>
        <logicTreeBranch branchID="G">
          <uncertaintyModel>extra5.xml</uncertaintyModel>
          <uncertaintyWeight>0.4</uncertaintyWeight>
        </logicTreeBranch>
      </logicTreeBranchSet>
    </logicTree>
  </nrml>

In this case only 3 + 2 = 5 paths are considered. You can see which
are the combinations by building the logic tree:

 >>> logictree = build(
 ...     ['sourceModel', [], ['A', 'common1.xml', 0.6],
 ...                         ['B', 'common2.xml', 0.4]],
 ...     ['extendModel', ['A'], ['C', 'extra1.xml', 0.6],
 ...                            ['D', 'extra2.xml', 0.2],
 ...                            ['E', 'extra3.xml', 0.2]],
 ...     ['extendModel', ['B'], ['F', 'extra4.xml', 0.6],
 ...                            ['G', 'extra5.xml', 0.4]])
 >>> logictree.get_all_paths()  # 3 + 2 paths
 ['AC.', 'AD.', 'AE..', 'BF.', 'BG.']

``applyToBranches`` can be used in different ways. For instance you can
attach the second ``extendModel`` to everything and get 8 paths:

 >>> logictree = build(
 ...     ['sourceModel', [], ['A', 'common1.xml', 0.6],
 ...                         ['B', 'common2.xml', 0.4]],
 ...     ['extendModel', ['A'], ['C', 'extra1.xml', 0.6],
 ...                            ['D', 'extra2.xml', 0.2],
 ...                            ['E', 'extra3.xml', 0.2]],
 ...     ['extendModel', [], ['F', 'extra4.xml', 0.6],
 ...                         ['G', 'extra5.xml', 0.4]])
 >>> logictree.get_all_paths()  # 3 * 2 + 2 paths
 ['ACF', 'ACG', 'ADF', 'ADG', 'AEF', 'AEG', 'B.F', 'B.G']

The complete realizations can be obtained by not specifying ``applyToBranches``:

.. code-block:: python

 >>> logictree = build(
 ...     ['sourceModel', [], ['A', 'common1.xml', 0.6],
 ...                         ['B', 'common2.xml', 0.4]],
 ...     ['extendModel', [], ['C', 'extra1.xml', 0.6],
 ...                         ['D', 'extra2.xml', 0.2],
 ...                         ['E', 'extra3.xml', 0.2]],
 ...     ['extendModel', [], ['F', 'extra4.xml', 0.6],
 ...                         ['G', 'extra5.xml', 0.4]])
 >>> logictree.get_all_paths() # 12 paths
 ['ACF', 'ACG', 'ADF', 'ADG', 'AEF', 'AEG', 'BCF', 'BCG', 'BDF', 'BDG', 'BEF', 'BEG']

The logic tree demo
-------------------

As another example we will consider the demo
``LogicTreeCase2ClassicalPSHA`` in the engine distribution; the
logic tree has the following structure:

.. code-block:: python

 >>> lt = build(
 ...    ['sourceModel', [], ['b11', 'source_model.xml', .333]],
 ...    ['abGRAbsolute', [], ['b21', '4.6 1.1', .333],
 ...                         ['b22', '4.5 1.0', .333],
 ...                         ['b23', '4.4 0.9', .334]],
 ...    ['abGRAbsolute', [], ['b31', '3.3 1.0', .333],
 ...                         ['b32', '3.2 0.9', .333],
 ...                         ['b33', '3.1 0.0', .334]],
 ...    ['maxMagGRAbsolute', [], ['b41', 7.0, .333],
 ...                             ['b42', 7.3, .333],
 ...                             ['b43', 7.6, .334]],
 ...    ['maxMagGRAbsolute', [], ['b51', 7.5, .333],
 ...                             ['b52', 7.8, .333],
 ...                             ['b53', 8.0, .334]],
 ...    ['Active Shallow Crust', [], ['c11', 'BA08', .5],
 ...                                 ['c12', 'CY12', .5]],
 ...    ['Stable Continental Crust', [], ['c21', 'TA02', .5],
 ...                                     ['c22', 'CA03', .5]])

Since the demo is using full enumeration there are 1*3*3*3*3*2*2 = 324
realizations in total that you can build as follows:

 >>> import numpy
 >>> paths = numpy.array(lt.get_all_paths())
 >>> for row in paths.reshape(36, 9):
 ...      print(' '.join(row))

The engine is computing all such realizations; after running the
calculations you will see an output called "Realizations". If you
export it, you will get a CSV file with the following structure::

  #,,"generated_by='OpenQuake engine 3.13..."
  rlz_id,branch_path,weight
  0,AAAAA~AA,3.0740926e-03
  1,AAAAA~AB,3.0740926e-03
  ...
  322,ACCCC~BA,3.1111853e-03
  323,ACCCC~BB,3.1111853e-03

For each realization there is a ``branch_path`` string which is split in
two parts separated by a tilde. The left part describes the branches of
the source model logic tree and the right part the branches of the gmpe
logic tree. In past versions of the engine the branch path was using
directly the branch IDs, so it was easy to assess the correspondence
between each realization and the associated branches.

Unfortunately, we had to remove that direct correspondence in engine
3.11. The reason is that engine is used in situations where the logic
tree has billions of billions of billions ... of billions potential
realizations, with hundreds of branchsets. If you have 100 branchsets
and the branch IDs are 10 characters long, each branch path will be
1000 characters long and impossible to display. The compact
representation requires only 1-character per branchset instead. It is
possible to pass from the compact representation to the original
branch IDs by using the command ``oq show branches``::

 $ oq show branches
 | branch_id | abbrev | uvalue              |
 |-----------+--------+---------------------|
 | b11       | A0     | source_model.xml    |
 | b21       | A1     | 4.60000 1.10000     |
 | b22       | B1     | 4.50000 1.00000     |
 | b23       | C1     | 4.40000 0.90000     |
 | b31       | A2     | 3.30000 1.00000     |
 | b32       | B2     | 3.20000 0.90000     |
 | b33       | C2     | 3.10000 0.80000     |
 | b41       | A3     | 7.00000             |
 | b42       | B3     | 7.30000             |
 | b43       | C3     | 7.60000             |
 | b51       | A4     | 7.50000             |
 | b52       | B4     | 7.80000             |
 | b53       | C4     | 8.00000             |
 | b11       | A0     | [BooreAtkinson2008] |
 | b12       | B0     | [ChiouYoungs2008]   |
 | b21       | A1     | [ToroEtAl2002]      |
 | b22       | B1     | [Campbell2003]      |

The first character of the ``abbrev`` specifies the branch number ("A"
means the first branch, "B" the second, etc) while the other characters
are the branch set number starting from zero. The format works up to
184 branches per branchset, using printable UTF8 characters.
For instance the realization #322 has the following branch path in
compact form::

 ACCCC~BA

which will expand to the following abbreviations (considering that fist "A"
corresponds to the branchset 0, the first "C" to branchset 1, the
second "C" to branchset 2, the third "C" to branchset 3, the fourth
"C" to branchset 4, "B" to branchset 0 of the GMPE logic tree and the
last "A" to branchset 1 of the GMPE logic tree)::

  A0 C1 C2 C3 C4 ~ B0 A1

and then, using the correspondence table ``abbrev->uvalue``, to::

  "source_model.xml" "4.4 0.9" "3.1 0.8" "7.6" "8.0" ~
  "[ChiouYoungs2008]" "[ToroEtAl2002]"

For convenience, the engine provides a simple command to display the content
of a realization, given the realization number::

 $ oq show rlz:322
 | uncertainty_type         | uvalue            |
 |--------------------------+-------------------|
 | sourceModel              | source_model.xml  |
 | abGRAbsolute             | 4.40000 0.90000   |
 | abGRAbsolute             | 3.10000 0.80000   |
 | maxMagGRAbsolute         | 7.60000           |
 | maxMagGRAbsolute         | 8.00000           |
 | Active Shallow Crust     | [ChiouYoungs2008] |
 | Stable Continental Crust | [ToroEtAl2002]    |

NB: the commands `oq show branches` and `oq show rlz` are new in
engine 3.13: they may change in the future and the string
representation of the branch path may change too. It has already
changed twice in engine 3.11 and engine 3.12. You cannot rely on
it across engine versions.

The concept of effective realizations
-------------------------------------

The management of the logic trees is the most complicated thing in the
OpenQuake engine. It is important to manage the logic trees in an
efficient way, by avoiding redundant computation and storage,
otherwise the engine will not be able to cope with large computations.
To that aim, it is essential to understand the concept of *effective
realizations*.

The crucial point is that in many calculations it is possible to reduce the
full logic tree (the tree of the potential realizations) to a much
smaller one (the tree of the effective realizations).

First, it is best to give some terminology.

1. for each source model in the source model logic tree there is potentially a
   different GMPE logic tree
2. the total number of realizations is the sum of the number of realizations
   of each GMPE logic tree
3. a GMPE logic tree is *trivial* if it has no tectonic region types with
   multiple GMPEs
4. a GMPE logic tree is *simple* if it has at most one tectonic region type
   with multiple GMPEs
5. a GMPE logic tree is *complex* if it has more than one tectonic region
   type with multiple GMPEs.

Here is an example of trivial GMPE logic tree, in its XML input representation:

.. code-block:: xml
  
   <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
   <nrml xmlns:gml="http://www.opengis.net/gml"
        xmlns="http://openquake.org/xmlns/nrml/0.4">
      <logicTree logicTreeID='lt1'>
              <logicTreeBranchSet uncertaintyType="gmpeModel" branchSetID="bs1"
                      applyToTectonicRegionType="active shallow crust">
  
                  <logicTreeBranch branchID="b1">
                      <uncertaintyModel>SadighEtAl1997</uncertaintyModel>
                      <uncertaintyWeight>1.0</uncertaintyWeight>
                  </logicTreeBranch>
  
              </logicTreeBranchSet>
      </logicTree>
   </nrml>

The logic tree is trivial since there is a single branch
("b1") and GMPE ("SadighEtAl1997") for each tectonic region
type ("active shallow crust").  A logic tree with multiple branches
can be simple, or even trivial if the tectonic region type
with multiple branches is not present in the underlying source
model. This is the key to the logic tree reduction concept.

Reduction of the logic tree
-----------------------------------------------

The simplest case of logic tree reduction is when the actual
sources do not span the full range of tectonic region types in the
GMPE logic tree file. This happens very often.
For instance, in the SHARE calculation for Europe
the GMPE logic tree potentially contains 1280 realizations
coming from 7 different tectonic region types:

Active_Shallow:
 4 GMPEs (b1, b2, b3, b4)
Stable_Shallow:
 5 GMPEs (b21, b22, b23, b24, b25)
Shield:
 2 GMPEs (b31, b32)
Subduction_Interface:
 4 GMPEs (b41, b42, b43, b44)
Subduction_InSlab:
 4 GMPEs (b51, b52, b53, b54)
Volcanic:
 1 GMPE (b61)
Deep:
 2 GMPEs (b71, b72)

The number of paths in the logic tree is 4 * 5 * 2 * 4 * 4 * 1 * 2 =
1280, pretty large. We say that there are 1280 *potential
realizations* per source model. However, in most computations, the
user will be interested only in a subset of them. For instance, if the
sources contributing to your region of interest are only of kind
*Active_Shallow* and *Stable_Shallow*, you would consider only 4 *
5 = 20 effective realizations instead of 1280. Doing so may improve
the computation time and the needed storage by a factor of 1280 / 20 =
64, which is very significant.

Having motivated the need for the concept of effective realizations,
let explain how it works in practice. For sake of simplicity let us
consider the simplest possible situation, when there are two tectonic
region types in the logic tree file, but the engine contains only
sources of one tectonic region type.  Let us assume that for the first
tectonic region type (T1) the GMPE logic tree file contains 3 GMPEs (A,
B, C) and that for the second tectonic region type (T2) the GMPE logic tree
file contains 2 GMPEs (D, E). The total number of realizations (assuming
full enumeration) is

  `total_num_rlzs = 3 * 2 = 6`

The realizations are identified by an ordered pair of GMPEs, one for each
tectonic region type. Let's number the realizations, starting from zero,
and let's identify the logic tree path with the notation
`<GMPE of first region type>_<GMPE of second region type>`:

== ========
#  lt_path
== ========
0   `A_D`
1   `B_D`
2   `C_D`
3   `A_E`
4   `B_E`
5   `C_E`
== ========

Now assume that the source model does not contain sources of tectonic
region type T1, or that such sources are filtered away since they are
too distant to have an effect: in such a situation we would expect to
have only 2 effective realizations corresponding to the GMPEs in the
second tectonic region type. The weight of each effective realizations
will be three times the weight of a regular representation, since
three different paths in the first tectonic region type will produce
exactly the same result. It is not important which GMPE was chosen
for the first tectonic region type because there are no sources of
kind T1. In such a situation there will be 2 effective realizations
coming from a total of 6 total realizations. It means that there will
be three copies of the outputs, i.e. three identical outputs for each
effective realization.

Starting from engine 3.9 *the logic tree reduction must be performed
manually*, by discarding the irrelevant tectonic region types; in
this example the user must add in the `job.ini` a line

``discard_trts = Shield, Subduction_Interface, Subduction_InSlab, Volcanic, Deep``

If not, multiple copies of the same outputs will appear.

How to analyze the logic tree of a calculation without running the calculation
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The engine provides some facilities to explore the logic tree of a
computation without running it. The command you need is the ``oq info`` command.
   
Let's assume that you have a zip archive called `SHARE.zip` containing the
SHARE source model, the SHARE source model logic tree file and the SHARE
GMPE logic tree file as provided by the SHARE collaboration, as well as
a `job.ini` file. If you run

  ``$ oq info SHARE.zip``

all the files will be parsed and the full logic tree of the computation
will be generated. This is very fast, it runs in exactly 1 minute on my
laptop, which is impressive, since the XML of the SHARE source models
is larger than 250 MB. Such speed come with a price: all the sources
are parsed, but they are not filtered, so you will get the complete
logic tree, not the one used by your computation, which will likely be
reduced because filtering will likely remove some tectonic region types.

The output of the `info` command will start with a `CompositionInfo`
object, which contains information about the composition of the source
model. You will get something like this::

   <CompositionInfo
   b1, area_source_model.xml, trt=[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], weight=0.500: 1280 realization(s)
   b2, faults_backg_source_model.xml, trt=[7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], weight=0.200: 1280 realization(s)
   b3, seifa_model.xml, trt=[14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19], weight=0.300: 640 realization(s)>

You can read the lines above as follows. The SHARE model is composed by three
submodels:

 * `area_source_model.xml` contains 7 Tectonic Region Types numbered from 0 to 7
   and produces 1280 potential realizations;
 * `faults_backg_source_model.xml` contains 7 Tectonic Region Types numbered from 7 to 13
   and produces 1280 potential realizations;
 * `seifa_model.xml` contains 6 Tectonic Region Types numbered from 14 to 19
   and produces 640 potential realizations;

In practice, you want to know if your complete logic tree will be
reduced by the filtering, i.e. you want to know the effective
realizations, not the potential ones. You can perform that check by
using the `--report` flag. This will generate a report with a name
like `report_<calc_id>.rst`::

   $ oq info --report SHARE.zip
   ...
   [2020-04-14 11:11:50 #2493 WARNING] No sources for some TRTs: you should set
   discard_trts = Subduction_InSlab, Deep
   ...
   Generated /home/michele/report_2493.rst

If you open that file you will find a lot of useful information about
the source model, its composition, the number of sources and ruptures
and the effective realizations.

Depending on the location of the points and the maximum distance, one
or more submodels could be completely filtered out and could produce
zero effective realizations, so the reduction effect could be even
stronger.

In any case *the warning tells the user what she should do* in order to
remove the duplication and reduce the calculation only to the effective
realizations, i.e. which are the TRTs to discard in the `job.ini` file.

Source Specific Logic Trees
=============================================

There are situations in which the hazard model is comprised by a small
number of sources, and for each source there is an individual logic
tree managing the uncertainty of a few parameters. In such situations
we say that we have a *Source Specific Logic Tree*.

Such situation is esemplified by the demo that you can find in
the directory ``demos/hazard/LogicTreeCase2ClassicalPSHA``, which has
the following logic tree, in XML form:

.. xml:

                </logicTreeBranch>
            </logicTreeBranchSet> 

As you can see, each branchset has an ``applyToSources`` attribute, pointing
to one of the two sources in the hazard model, therefore we have a source
specific logic tree.
   
In compact form we can represent the logic tree as the composition
of two source specific logic trees with the following branchsets::

 src "1": [<abGRAbsolute(3)>, <maxMagGRAbsolute(3)>]
 src "2": [<abGRAbsolute(3)>, <maxMagGRAbsolute(3)>]

The ``(X)`` notation denotes the number of branches for each branchset and
multiplying such numbers we can deduce the size of the full logic tree
(ignoring the gsim logic tree for sake of simplificity)::

  (3 x 3 for src "1") x (3 x 3 for src "2") = 81 realizations

It is possible to see the full logic tree as the product of two source
specific logic trees each one with 9 realizations. The interesting thing
it that the engine will require storage and computational power proportional
to 9 + 9 = 18 basic components and not to the 9 * 9 = 81 final realizations.
In general if there are N source specific logic trees, each one generating
R_i realizations with i in the range 0..N-1, the number of basic components
and final realizations are respectively::

 C = sum(R_i)
 R = prod(R_i)

In the demo the storage is over 4 times less (18 vs 81); in more
complex cases the gain than can be much more impressive. For instance
the ZAF model in our mosaic (the national model for South Africa)
contains a source specific logic tree with 22 sources that can be
decomposed as follows:

.. code:

   >> full_lt = readinput.get_full_lt(oq)
   >> dic = full_lt.source_model_lt.decompose()
   >> pprint(dic)
   {'1': <SSLT:1 [<abGRAbsolute(3)>, <maxMagGRAbsolute(4)>]>,
   '10': <SSLT:10 [<abGRAbsolute(4)>, <maxMagGRAbsolute(3)>]>,
   '11': <SSLT:11 [<abGRAbsolute(4)>, <maxMagGRAbsolute(2)>]>,
   '12': <SSLT:12 [<abGRAbsolute(3)>, <maxMagGRAbsolute(3)>]>,
   '13': <SSLT:13 [<abGRAbsolute(2)>, <maxMagGRAbsolute(2)>]>,
   '14': <SSLT:14 [<abGRAbsolute(3)>, <maxMagGRAbsolute(4)>]>,
   '15': <SSLT:15 [<abGRAbsolute(3)>, <maxMagGRAbsolute(3)>]>,
   '16': <SSLT:16 [<abGRAbsolute(4)>, <maxMagGRAbsolute(3)>]>,
   '17': <SSLT:17 [<abGRAbsolute(4)>, <maxMagGRAbsolute(3)>]>,
   '18': <SSLT:18 [<abGRAbsolute(2)>, <maxMagGRAbsolute(2)>]>,
   '19': <SSLT:19 [<abGRAbsolute(3)>, <maxMagGRAbsolute(3)>]>,
   '2': <SSLT:2 [<abGRAbsolute(2)>, <maxMagGRAbsolute(3)>]>,
   '20': <SSLT:20 [<abGRAbsolute(2)>, <maxMagGRAbsolute(2)>]>,
   '21': <SSLT:21 [<abGRAbsolute(2)>, <maxMagGRAbsolute(3)>]>,
   '22': <SSLT:22 [<abGRAbsolute(4)>, <maxMagGRAbsolute(3)>]>,
   '23': <SSLT:23 [<abGRAbsolute(2)>, <maxMagGRAbsolute(3)>]>,
   '24': <SSLT:24 [<abGRAbsolute(2)>, <maxMagGRAbsolute(2)>]>,
   '3': <SSLT:3 [<abGRAbsolute(5)>, <maxMagGRAbsolute(4)>]>,
   '4': <SSLT:4 [<abGRAbsolute(3)>, <maxMagGRAbsolute(2)>]>,
   '5': <SSLT:5 [<abGRAbsolute(3)>, <maxMagGRAbsolute(3)>]>,
   '8': <SSLT:8 [<abGRAbsolute(2)>, <maxMagGRAbsolute(2)>]>,
   '9': <SSLT:9 [<abGRAbsolute(3)>, <maxMagGRAbsolute(2)>]>}
   >> C, R = 0, 1
   >> for sslt in dic.values():
   ..  Rs = sslt.get_num_paths()
   ..  C += Rs
   ..  R *= Rs
   >> print(C, R)
   186 24959374950829916160

In other words, by storing only 186 components we can save enough information
to build 24_959_374_950_829_916_160 realizations, with a gain of over 10^17!

Extracting the hazard curves
-------------------------------------------------

While it is impossible to compute the hazard curves for
24_959_374_950_829_916_160 realizations, it is quite possible to
get the source-specific hazard curves. To this end the engine
provides a class ``HcurvesGetter`` with a method ``.get_hcurves``
which is able to retrieve all the curves associated to the
realizations of the logic tree associated to a specific source.
Here is the usage:

.. code::

 from openquake.commonlib.datastore import read
 from openquake.calculators.getters import HcurvesGetter

 getter = HcurvesGetter(read(-1))
 print(getter.get_hcurves('1', 'PGA'))  # array of shape (Rs, L)

Looking at the source-specific realizations is useful to assess if
the logic tree can be collapsed.


Sampling of the logic tree
----------------------------------------------------

There are real life examples of very large logic trees, like the model
for South Africa which features 3,194,799,993,706,229,268,480 branches.
In such situations it is impossible to perform a computation with full
enumeration. However, the engine allows to
sample the branches of the complete logic tree. More precisely,
for each branch sampled from the source model logic tree,
a branch of the GMPE logic tree is chosen randomly,
by taking into account the weights in the GMPE logic tree file.

It should be noticed that even if source model path is sampled several
times, the model is parsed and sent to the workers *only once*. In
particular if there is a single source model (like for South America)
and ``number_of_logic_tree_samples =100``, we generate effectively 1
source model realization and not 100 equivalent source model
realizations, as we did in past (actually in the engine version 1.3).
The engine keeps track of how many times a model has been sampled (say
`Ns`) and in the event based case it produce ruptures (*with different
seeds*) by calling the appropriate hazardlib function `Ns` times. This
is done inside the worker nodes. In the classical case, all the
ruptures are identical and there are no seeds, so the computation is
done only once, in an efficient way.


Logic tree sampling strategies
==============================

Stating from version 3.10, the OpenQuake engine suppports 4 different
strategies for sampling the logic tree. They are called, respectively,
``early_weights``, ``late_weights``, ``early_latin``, ``late_latin``.
Here we will discuss how they work.

First of all, we must point out that logic tree sampling is controlled
by three parameters in the job.ini:

- number_of_logic_tree_samples (default 0, no sampling)
- sampling_method (default ``early_weights``)
- random_seed (default 42)

When sampling is enabled ``number_of_logic_tree_samples`` is a positive
number, equal to the number of branches to be randomly extracted from
full logic tree of the calculation. The precise why the random extraction
works depends on the sampling method.

early_weights
  With this sampling method, the engine randomly choose branches depending
  on the weights in the logic tree; having done that, the hazard curve
  statistics (mean and quantiles) are computed with equal weights.

late_weights
  With this sampling method, the engine randomly choose branches ignoring
  the weights in the logic tree; however, the hazard curve
  statistics are computed by taking into account the weights.

early_latin
  With this sampling method, the engine randomly choose branches depending
  on the weights in the logic tree by using an hypercube latin sampling;
  having done that, the hazard curve statistics are computed with equal weights.

late_latin
  Wit this sampling method, the engine randomly choose branches ignoring
  the weights in the logic tree, but still using an hypercube sampling;
  then, the hazard curve statistics are computed by taking into account
  the weights.

More precisely, the engine calls something like the function::

  openquake.hazardlib.lt.random_sample(
    branchsets, num_samples, seed, sampling_method)

You are invited to play with it; in general the latin sampling produces
samples much closer to the expected weights even with few samples.
Here in an example with two branchsets with weights [.4, .6] and
[.2, .3, .5] respectively.

    >>> import collections
    >>> from openquake.hazardlib.lt import random_sample
    >>> bsets = [[('X', .4), ('Y', .6)], [('A', .2), ('B', .3), ('C', .5)]]

With 100 samples one would expect to get the path XA 8 times, XB 12
times, XC 20 times, YA 12 times, YB 18 times, YC 30 times. Instead we get:

    >>> paths = random_sample(bsets, 100, 42, 'early_weights')
    >>> collections.Counter(paths)
    Counter({'YC': 26, 'XC': 24, 'YB': 17, 'XA': 13, 'YA': 10, 'XB': 10})

    >>> paths = random_sample(bsets, 100, 42, 'late_weights')
    >>> collections.Counter(paths)
    Counter({'XA': 20, 'YA': 18, 'XB': 17, 'XC': 15, 'YB': 15, 'YC': 15})

    >>> paths = random_sample(bsets, 100, 42, 'early_latin')
    >>> collections.Counter(paths)
    Counter({'YC': 31, 'XC': 19, 'YB': 17, 'XB': 13, 'YA': 12, 'XA': 8})

    >>> paths = random_sample(bsets, 100, 45, 'late_latin')
    >>> collections.Counter(paths)
    Counter({'YC': 18, 'XA': 18, 'XC': 16, 'YA': 16, 'XB': 16, 'YB': 16})

   
GMPE logic trees with weighted IMTs
-----------------------------------

In order to support Canada's 5th Generation seismic hazard model, the engine now
has the ability to manage GMPE logic trees where the weight assigned to each
GMPE may be different for each IMT. For instance you could have a particular
GMPE applied to PGA with a certain weight, to SA(0.1) with a different weight,
and to SA(1.0) with yet another weight. The user may want to assign a higher
weight to the IMTs where the GMPE has a small uncertainty and a lower weight to
the IMTs with a large uncertainty. Moreover a particular GMPE may not be
applicable for some periods, and in that case the user can assign to a zero
weight for those periods, in which case the engine will ignore it entirely for
those IMTs. This is useful when you have a logic tree with multiple GMPEs per
branchset, some of which are applicable for some IMTs and not for others.  Here
is an example:

.. code-block:: xml

    <logicTreeBranchSet uncertaintyType="gmpeModel" branchSetID="bs1"
            applyToTectonicRegionType="Volcanic">
        <logicTreeBranch branchID="BooreEtAl1997GeometricMean">
            <uncertaintyModel>BooreEtAl1997GeometricMean</uncertaintyModel>
            <uncertaintyWeight>0.33</uncertaintyWeight>
            <uncertaintyWeight imt="PGA">0.25</uncertaintyWeight>
            <uncertaintyWeight imt="SA(0.5)">0.5</uncertaintyWeight>
            <uncertaintyWeight imt="SA(1.0)">0.5</uncertaintyWeight>
            <uncertaintyWeight imt="SA(2.0)">0.5</uncertaintyWeight>
        </logicTreeBranch>
        <logicTreeBranch branchID="SadighEtAl1997">
            <uncertaintyModel>SadighEtAl1997</uncertaintyModel>
            <uncertaintyWeight>0.33</uncertaintyWeight>
            <uncertaintyWeight imt="PGA">0.25</uncertaintyWeight>
            <uncertaintyWeight imt="SA(0.5)">0.5</uncertaintyWeight>
            <uncertaintyWeight imt="SA(1.0)">0.5</uncertaintyWeight>
            <uncertaintyWeight imt="SA(2.0)">0.5</uncertaintyWeight>
        </logicTreeBranch>
        <logicTreeBranch branchID="MunsonThurber1997Hawaii">
            <uncertaintyModel>MunsonThurber1997Hawaii</uncertaintyModel>
            <uncertaintyWeight>0.34</uncertaintyWeight>
            <uncertaintyWeight imt="PGA">0.25</uncertaintyWeight>
            <uncertaintyWeight imt="SA(0.5)">0.0</uncertaintyWeight>
            <uncertaintyWeight imt="SA(1.0)">0.0</uncertaintyWeight>
            <uncertaintyWeight imt="SA(2.0)">0.0</uncertaintyWeight>
        </logicTreeBranch>
        <logicTreeBranch branchID="Campbell1997">
            <uncertaintyModel>Campbell1997</uncertaintyModel>
            <uncertaintyWeight>0.0</uncertaintyWeight>
            <uncertaintyWeight imt="PGA">0.25</uncertaintyWeight>
            <uncertaintyWeight imt="SA(0.5)">0.0</uncertaintyWeight>
            <uncertaintyWeight imt="SA(1.0)">0.0</uncertaintyWeight>
            <uncertaintyWeight imt="SA(2.0)">0.0</uncertaintyWeight>
        </logicTreeBranch>
    </logicTreeBranchSet>        

Clearly the weights for each IMT must sum up to 1, otherwise the engine
will complain. Note that this feature only works for the classical
calculators: in the event based case only the default
