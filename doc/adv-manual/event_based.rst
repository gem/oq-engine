Event Based and Scenarios
=========================

Scenario risk calculations usually do not pose a performance problem,
since they involve a single rupture and limited geographical region for analysis. 
Some event-based risk calculations, however, may involve millions of ruptures
and exposures spanning entire countries or even continents. This section
offers some practical tips for running large event-based risk calculations, 
especially ones involving large logic trees, and proposes techniques that might
be used to make an otherwise intractable calculation tractable.

Understanding the hazard
------------------------

Event-based calculations are typically dominated by the hazard component
(unless there are lots of assets aggregated on a few hazard sites) and
therefore the first thing to do is to estimate the size of the hazard,
i.e. the number of GMFs that will be produced. Since we are talking about
a large calculation, first of all, we need to reduce it to a size that is 
guaranteed to run quickly. The simplest way to do that is to reduce the 
parameters directly affecting the number of ruptures generated, i.e.

- investigation_time
- ses_per_logic_tree_path
- number_of_logic_tree_samples

For instance, if you have ``ses_per_logic_tree_path = 10,000`` reduce
it to 10, run the calculation and you will see in the log something
like this::

  [2018-12-16 09:09:57,689 #35263 INFO] Received
  {'gmfdata': '752.18 MB', 'hcurves': '224 B', 'indices': '29.42 MB'}

The amount of GMFs generated for the reduced calculation is 752.18 MB; 
and since the calculation has been reduced by a factor of 1,000, 
the full computation is likely to generate around 750 GB of GMFs. 
Even if you have sufficient disk space to store this large quantity of GMFs, 
most likely you will run out of memory. Even if the hazard part of the 
calculation manages to run to completion, the risk part of the calculation
is very likely to fail â€” managing 750 GB of GMFs is beyond the current 
capabilities of the engine. Thus, you will have to find ways to reduce the
size of the computation. 

A good start would be to carefully set the parameters 
``minimum_magnitude`` and ``minimum_intensity``:

- ``minimum_magnitude`` is a scalar or a dictionary keyed by tectonic region;
  the engine will discard ruptures with magnitudes below the given thresholds
- ``minimum_intensity`` is a scalar or a dictionary keyed by the intensity
  measure type; the engine will discard GMFs below the given intensity thresholds

Choosing reasonable cutoff thresholds with these parameters can significantly
reduce the size of your computation when there are a large number of 
small magnitude ruptures or low intensity GMFs being generated, which may have
a negligible impact on the damage or losses, and thus could be safely discarded.

region_grid_spacing
---------------------

In our experience, the most common error made by our users is to
compute the hazard at the sites of the exposure. The issue is that it
is possible to have exposures with millions of assets on millions of
distinct hazard sites. Computing the GMFs for millions of sites is
hard or even impossible (there is a limit of 4 billion rows on the
size of the GMF table in the datastore). Even in the cases when
computing the hazard is possible, then computing the risk starting
from an extremely large amount of GMFs will likely be impossible, due
to memory/runtime constraints.

The second most common error is using an extremely fine grid for the
site model. Remember that if you have a resolution of 250 meters, a
square of 250 km x 250 km will contain one million sites, which is
definitely too much. The engine was designed when the site models
had resolutions around 5-10 km, i.e. of the same order of the hazard
grid, while nowadays the vs30 fields have a much larger resolution.

Both problems can be solved in a simple way by specifying the
``region_grid_spacing`` parameter. Make it large enough that the
resulting number of sites becomes reasonable and you are done.
You will lose some precision, but that is preferable to not
being able to run the calculation. You will need to run a sensitivity
analysis with different values of ``region_grid_spacing`` parameter
to make sure that you get consistent results, but that's it.

Once a ``region_grid_spacing`` is specified, the engine computes the
convex hull of the exposure sites and builds a grid of hazard sites,
associating the site parameters from the closest site in the site model
and discarding sites in the region where there are no assets (i.e. more
distant than ``region_grid_spacing * sqrt(2)``). The precise logic
is encoded in the function
``openquake.commonlib.readinput.get_sitecol_assetcol``, if you want
to know the specific implementation details.

Our recommendation is to use the command ``oq prepare_site_model`` to
apply such logic before starting a calculation and thus producing a
custom site model file tailored to your exposure (see the section
:ref:`prepare_site_model`).


Collapsing of branches
----------------------

When one is not interested in the uncertainty around the loss
estimates and cares more about the mean estimates, all of the
source model branches can be "collapsed" into one branch. Using the
collapsed source model should yield the same mean hazard or loss
estimates as using the full source model logic tree and then computing
the weighted mean of the individual branch results.

Similarly, the GMPE logic tree for each tectonic region can also be "collapsed"
into a single branch. Using a single collapsed GMPE for each TRT
should also yield the same mean hazard estimates as using the full
GMPE logic tree and then computing the weighted mean of the individual
branch results. This has become possible through the introduction of 
`AvgGMPE feature <https://github.com/gem/oq-engine/blob/engine-3.9/openquake/qa_tests_data/classical/case_19/gmpe_logic_tree.xml#L26-L40>`_ in version 3.9.

Using ``collect_rlzs=true`` in the risk calculation
---------------------------------------------------

Since version 3.12 the engine recognizes a flag ``collect_rlzs`` in
the risk configuration file. When the flag is set to true, then the
hazard realizations are collected together *when computing the risk
results* and considered as one.

Setting ``collect_rlzs=true`` is
possible only when the weights of the realizations are all equal,
otherwise, the engine raises an error. Collecting the realizations
makes the calculation of the average losses and loss curves much
faster and more memory efficient. It is the recommended way to proceed
when you are interested only in mean results. When you have a large
exposure and many realizations (say 5 million assets and 1000
realizations, as it is the case for Chile) setting ``collect_rlzs=true``
can make possible a calculation that otherwise would run out of memory.

Note 1: when using sampling, ``collect_rlzs`` is implicitly set to
``True``, so if you want to export the individual results per
realization you must set explicitly ``collect_rlzs=false``.

Note 2: ``collect_rlzs`` is not the inverse of the ``individual_rlzs``
flag. The ``collect_rlzs`` flag indicates to
the engine that it should pool together the hazard realizations into a
single collective bucket that will then be used to approximate the 
branch-averaged risk metrics directly, without going through the process
of first computing the individual branch results and then getting the 
weighted average results from the branch results. Whereas the 
``individual_rlzs`` flag indicates to the engine that the user is
interested in storing and exporting the hazard (or risk) results for
every realization. Setting ``individual_rlzs`` to ``false`` means that
the engine will store only the statistics (mean and quantile results)
in the datastore.

Note 3: ``collect_rlzs`` is completely ignored in the hazard part of
the calculation, i.e. it does not affect at all the computation of the GMFs,
only the computation of the risk metrics.

Splitting the calculation into subregions
-----------------------------------------

If one is interested in propagating the full uncertainty in the source
models or ground motion models to the hazard or loss estimates,
collapsing the logic trees into a single branch to reduce
computational expense is not an option. But before going through the
effort of trimming the logic trees, there is an interim step that must
be explored, at least for large regions, like the entire continental
United States.  This step is to geographically divide the large region
into logical smaller subregions, such that the contribution to the
hazard or losses in one subregion from the other subregions is
negligibly small or even zero.  The effective realizations in each of
the subregions will then be much fewer than when trying to cover the
entire large region in a single calculation.

Trimming of the logic-trees or sampling of the branches
-------------------------------------------------------

Trimming or sampling may be necessary if the following two
conditions hold:

1. You are interested in propagating the full uncertainty to the
   hazard and loss estimates; only the mean or quantile results are
   not sufficient for your analysis requirements, AND
2. The region of interest cannot be logically divided further as
   described above; the logic-tree for your chosen region of interest
   still leads to a very large number of effective realizations.

Sampling is the easier of the two options now. You only need to ensure
that you sample a sufficient number of branches to capture the
underlying distribution of the hazard or loss results you are
interested in. The drawback of random sampling is that you may still
need to sample hundreds of branches to capture well the underlying
distribution of the results.

Trimming can be much more efficient than sampling, because you pick a
few branches such that the distribution of the hazard or loss results
obtained from a full-enumeration of these branches is nearly the same
as the distribution of the hazard or loss results obtained from a
full-enumeration of the entire logic-tree.

ignore_covs vs ignore_master_seed
----------------------------------------------------------------

The vulnerability functions using continuous distributions (lognormal/beta)
to characterize the uncertainty in the loss ratio, specify the mean loss
ratios and the corresponding coefficients of variation for a set of intensity
levels.

There is clearly a performance/memory penalty associated with the propagation
of uncertainty in the vulnerability to losses. You can completely remove it by
setting

``ignore_covs = true``

in the `job.ini` file. Then the engine would compute just the mean loss
ratios by ignoring the uncertainty i.e. the coefficients of variation.
Since engine 3.12 there is a better solution: setting

``ignore_master_seed = true``

in the `job.ini` file. Then the engine will compute the mean loss
ratios but also store information about the uncertainty of the results
in the asset loss table, in the column "variance", by using the formulae

.. math::

    variance &= \Sigma_i \sigma_i^2 \ for\ asset\_correl=0 \\
    variance &= (\Sigma_i \sigma_i)^2 \ for\ asset\_correl=1

in terms of the variance of each asset for the event and intensity level in
consideration, extracted from the asset loss and the
coefficients of variation. People interested in the details should look at
the implementation in https://github.com/gem/oq-engine/blob/engine-3.17/openquake/risklib/scientific.py.

The asset loss table
====================

When performing an event based risk calculation the engine
keeps in memory a table with the losses for each asset and each event,
for each loss type. It is usually impossible to fully store such a table,
because it is extremely large; for instance, for 1 million assets, 1
million events, 2 loss types and 4 bytes per loss ~8 TB of disk space
would be required. It is true that many events will produce zero losses
because of the `maximum_distance` and `minimum_intensity` parameters,
but still, the asset loss table is prohibitively large and for many years
could not be stored. In engine 3.8 we made a breakthrough: we decided to
store a partial asset loss table, obtained by discarding small losses,
by leveraging on the fact that loss curves for long enough return periods
are dominated by extreme events, i.e. there is no point in saving all
the small losses.

To that aim, the engine honours a parameter called
``minimum_asset_loss`` which determines how many losses are discarded
when storing the asset loss table. The rule is simple: losses below
``minimum_asset_loss`` are discarded. By choosing the threshold
properly in an ideal world

1. the vast majority of the losses would be discarded, thus making the
   asset loss table storable;
2. the loss curves would still be nearly identical to the ones without
   discarding any loss, except for small return periods.

It is the job of the user to verify if 1 and 2 are true in the real world.
He can assess that by playing with the ``minimum_asset_loss`` in a small
calculation, finding a good value for it, and then extending it to the large
calculation. Clearly, it is a matter of compromise: by sacrificing precision
it is possible to reduce enormously the size of the stored asset loss table
and to make an impossible calculation possible.

Starting from engine 3.11 the asset loss table is stored if the user
specifies

``aggregate_by = id``

in the job.ini file. In large calculations it is extremely easy to run out of
memory or make the calculation extremely slow, so we recommend
not to store the asset loss table. The functionality is there for the sole
purpose of debugging small calculations, for instance, to see the effect
of the ``minimum_asset_loss`` approximation at the asset level.

For large calculations usually one is interested in the aggregate loss
table, which contains the losses per event and per aggregation tag (or
multi-tag). For instance, the tag ``occupancy`` has the three values
"Residential", "Industrial" and "Commercial" and by setting

``aggregate_by = occupancy``

the engine will store a pandas DataFrame called ``risk_by_event`` with a
field ``agg_id`` with 4 possible value: 0 for "Residential", 1 for
"Industrial", 2 for "Commercial" and 3 for the full aggregation.

NB: if the parameter ``aggregate_by`` is not specified, the engine will
still compute the aggregate loss table but then the ``agg_id`` field will
have a single value of 0 corresponding to the total portfolio losses.

The Probable Maximum Loss (PML) and the loss curves
---------------------------------------------------

Given an effective investigation time and a return period,
the engine is able to compute a PML for each
aggregation tag. It does so by using the function
``openquake.risklib.scientific.losses_by_period`` which takes as input
an array of cumulative losses associated with the aggregation tag, a
list of the return periods, and the effective investigation time. If
there is a single return period the function returns the PML; if there are
multiple return periods it returns the loss curve. The two concepts
are essentially the same thing, since a loss curve is just an array of
PMLs, one for each return period. 

For instance:

.. code-block:: python

   >>> from openquake.risklib.scientific import losses_by_period
   >>> losses = [3, 2, 3.5, 4, 3, 23, 11, 2, 1, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 13, 0]
   >>> [PML_500y] = losses_by_period(losses, [500], eff_time=1000)
   >>> PML_500y
   13.0

computes the Probably Maximum Loss at 500 years for the given losses
with an effective investigation time of 1000 years. The algorithm works
by ordering the losses (suppose there are E losses,  E > 1) generating E time
periods ``eff_time/E, eff_time/(E-1), ... eff_time/1``, and log-interpolating
the loss at the return period. Of course this works only if the condition
``eff_time/E < return_period < eff_time`` is respected.

In this example there are E=16 losses, so the return period
must be in the range 62.5 .. 1000 years. If the return period is too
small the PML will be zero

>>> losses_by_period(losses, [50], eff_time=1000)
array([0.])

while if the return period is outside the investigation range, we will
refuse the temptation to extrapolate and we will return NaN instead:

>>> losses_by_period(losses, [1500], eff_time=1000)
array([nan])

The rules above are the reason why you will see zeros or NaNs in the
loss curves generated by the engine sometimes, especially when there are
too few events (the valid range will be small and some return periods
may slip outside the range).

Aggregate loss curves
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
In some cases the computation of the PML is particularly simple and
you can do it by hand: this happens when the ratio
``eff_time/return_period`` is an integer. Consider for instance a case with
``eff_time=10,000`` years and ``return_period=2,000`` years;
suppose there are the following 10 losses aggregating the commercial
and residential buildings of an exposure:

>>> import numpy as np
>>> losses_COM = np.array([123, 0, 400, 0, 1500, 200, 350, 0, 700, 600])
>>> losses_RES = np.array([0, 800, 200, 0, 500, 1200, 250, 600, 300, 150])

The loss curve associate the highest loss to 10,000 years, the second
highest to 10,000 / 2 years, the third highest to 10,000 / 3 years, the
fourth highest to 10,000 / 4 years, the fifth highest to 10,000 / 5 years
and so on until the lowest loss is associated to 10,000 / 10 years.
Since the return period is 2,000 = 10,000 / 5 to compute the MPL
it is enough to take the fifth loss ordered in descending order:

>>> MPL_COM = [1500, 700, 600, 400, 350, 200, 123, 0, 0, 0][4] = 350
>>> MPL_RES = [1200, 800, 600, 500, 300, 250, 200, 150, 0, 0][4] = 300

Given this algorithm, it is clear why the MPL cannot be additive, i.e.
MPL(COM + RES) != MPL(COM) + MPL(RES): doing the sums before or
after the ordering of the losses is different. In this example
by taking the fifth loss of the sorted sums

>>> sorted(losses_COM + losses_RES, reverse=True)
[2000, 1400, 1000, 800, 750, 600, 600, 600, 123, 0]

one gets ``MPL(COM + RES) = 750`` which is different from
``MPL(RES) + MPL(COM) = 350 + 300 = 650``.

The engine is able to compute aggregate loss curves correctly, i.e.
by doing the sums before the ordering phase. In order to perform
aggregations, you need to set the ``aggregate_by`` parameter in the
``job.ini`` by specifying tags over which you wish to perform the
aggregation. Your exposure must contain the specified tags
for each asset.  We have an example for Nepal in our event based risk
demo.  The exposure for this demo contains various tags and in
particular a geographic tag called NAME_1 with values "Mid-Western",
"Far-Western", "West", "East", "Central", and the ``job_eb.ini`` file
defines

``aggregate_by = NAME_1``

When running the calculation you will see something like this::

   Calculation 1 finished correctly in 17 seconds
  id | name
   9 | Aggregate Event Losses
   1 | Aggregate Loss Curves
   2 | Aggregate Loss Curves Statistics
   3 | Aggregate Losses
   4 | Aggregate Losses Statistics
   5 | Average Asset Losses Statistics
  11 | Earthquake Ruptures
   6 | Events
   7 | Full Report
   8 | Input Files
  10 | Realizations
  12 | Total Loss Curves
  13 | Total Loss Curves Statistics
  14 | Total Losses
  15 | Total Losses Statistics

Exporting the *Aggregate Loss Curves Statistics* output will give
you the mean and quantile loss curves in a format like the following one::

    annual_frequency_of_exceedence,return_period,loss_type,loss_value,loss_ratio

    1.00000E-03,1000,structural,1.15148E+07,4.38439E-01
    
If you do not set the ``aggregate_by`` parameter
you will still be able to compute the total loss curve 
(for the entire portfolio of assets), and the total average losses.

.. _aggregating_by_multiple_tags:

Aggregating by multiple tags
----------------------------

The engine also supports aggregation by multiple tags. 
Multiple tags can be indicated as multi-tag and/or various single-tag aggregations:

``aggregate_by = NAME_1, taxonomy``

or

``aggregate_by = NAME_1; taxonomy``

Comma ``,`` separated values will generate keys for all the possible 
combinations of the indicated tag values, while semicolon ``;`` 
will generate keys for the single tags.

For instance the second event based risk demo 
(the file ``job_eb.ini``) has a line

``aggregate_by = NAME_1, taxonomy``

and it is able to aggregate both on geographic region (``NAME_1``) and
on ``taxonomy``. There are 25 possible combinations, that you can see with
the command `oq show agg_keys`::

   $ oq show agg_keys
   | NAME_1_ | taxonomy_ | NAME_1      | taxonomy                   |
   +---------+-----------+-------------+----------------------------+

   | 5       | 2         | Central     | Adobe                      |
   | 5       | 3         | Central     | Stone-Masonry              |
   | 5       | 4         | Central     | Unreinforced-Brick-Masonry |
   | 5       | 5         | Central     | Concrete                   |

The lines in this table are associated to the *generalized aggregation ID*,
``agg_id`` which is an index going from ``0`` (meaning aggregate assets with
NAME_1=*Mid-Western* and taxonomy=*Wood*) to ``24`` (meaning aggregate assets
with NAME_1=*Central* and taxonomy=*Concrete*); moreover ``agg_id=25`` means
full aggregation.

The ``agg_id`` field enters in ``risk_by_event`` and in outputs like
the aggregate losses; for instance::

   $ oq show agg_losses-rlzs
   | agg_id | rlz | loss_type     | value       |
   +--------+-----+---------------+-------------+
   | 0      | 0   | nonstructural | 2_327_008   |
   | 0      | 0   | structural    | 937_852     |
   +--------+-----+---------------+-------------+
   | ...    + ... + ...           + ...         +
   +--------+-----+---------------+-------------+
   | 25     | 1   | nonstructural | 100_199_448 |
   | 25     | 1   | structural    | 157_885_648 |

The exporter (``oq export agg_losses-rlzs``) converts back the ``agg_id``
to the proper combination of tags; ``agg_id=25``, i.e. full aggregation,
is replaced with the string ``*total*``.

It is possible to see the ``agg_id`` field with the command
``$ oq show agg_id``.

By knowing the number of events, the number of aggregation keys and the
number of loss types, it is possible to give an upper limit to the size
of ``risk_by_event``. In the demo there are 1703 events, 26 aggregation
keys and 2 loss types, so ``risk_by_event`` contains at most

  1703 * 26 * 2 = 88,556 rows

This is an upper limit, since some combination can produce zero losses
and are not stored, especially if the ``minimum_asset_loss`` feature is
used. In the case of the demo actually only 20,877 rows are nonzero::

   $ oq show risk_by_event
          event_id  agg_id  loss_id           loss      variance
   ...
   [20877 rows x 5 columns]

It is also possible to perform the aggregation by various single-tag aggregations,
using the ``;`` separator instead of ``,``. For example, a line like

   ``aggregate_by = NAME_1; taxonomy``

would produce first the aggregation by geographic region (``NAME_1``), then
by ``taxonomy``. In this case, instead of producing 5 x 5 combinations, only
5 + 5 outputs would be obtained.


Rupture sampling: how does it work?
===================================

In this section we explain how the sampling of ruptures in event based
calculations works, at least for the case of Poissonian sources.
As an example, consider the following point source:

>>> from openquake.hazardlib import nrml
>>> src = nrml.get('''\
... <pointSource id="1" name="Point Source"
...              tectonicRegion="Active Shallow Crust">
...     <pointGeometry>
...         <gml:Point><gml:pos>179.5 0</gml:pos></gml:Point>
...         <upperSeismoDepth>0</upperSeismoDepth>
...         <lowerSeismoDepth>10</lowerSeismoDepth>
...     </pointGeometry>
...     <magScaleRel>WC1994</magScaleRel>
...     <ruptAspectRatio>1.5</ruptAspectRatio>
...     <truncGutenbergRichterMFD aValue="3" bValue="1" minMag="5" maxMag="7"/>
...     <nodalPlaneDist>
...         <nodalPlane dip="30" probability="1" strike="45" rake="90" />
...     </nodalPlaneDist>
...     <hypoDepthDist>
...         <hypoDepth depth="4" probability="1"/>
...     </hypoDepthDist>
... </pointSource>''', investigation_time=1, width_of_mfd_bin=1.0)

The source here is particularly simple, with only one
seismogenic depth and one nodal plane. It generates two ruptures,
because with a ``width_of_mfd_bin`` of 1 there are only two magnitudes in
the range from 5 to 7:

>>> [(mag1, rate1), (mag2, rate2)] = src.get_annual_occurrence_rates()
>>> mag1
5.5
>>> mag2
6.5

The occurrence rates are respectively 0.009 and 0.0009. So, if we set
the number of stochastic event sets to 1,000,000

>>> num_ses = 1_000_000

we would expect the first rupture (the one with magnitude 5.5) to
occur around 9,000 times and the second rupture (the one with magnitude
6.5) to occur around 900 times. Clearly the exact numbers will depend on
the stochastic seed; if we set

>>> np.random.seed(42)

then we will have (for ``investigation_time = 1``)

>>> np.random.poisson(rate1 * num_ses * 1)
8966
>>> np.random.poisson(rate2 * num_ses * 1)
921

These are the number of occurrences of each rupture in the effective
investigation time, i.e. the investigation time multiplied by the
number of stochastic event sets and the number of realizations (here we
assumed 1 realization).

The total number of events generated by the source will be

``number_of_events = sum(n_occ for each rupture)``

i.e. 8,966 + 921 = 9,887, with ~91% of the events associated to the first
rupture and ~9% of the events associated to the second rupture.

Since the details of the seed algorithm can change with updates to the
the engine, if you run an event based calculation with the same
parameters with different versions of the engine, you may not get 
exactly the same number of events, but something close given a reasonably
long effective investigation time. After running the calculation, inside
the datastore, in the ``ruptures`` dataset you will find the two
ruptures, their occurrence rates and their integer number of
occurrences (``n_occ``). If the effective investigation time is large
enough then the relation

``n_occ ~ occurrence_rate * eff_investigation_time``

will hold. If the effective investigation time is not large enough, or the
occurrence rate is extremely small, then you should expect to see larger
differences between the expected number of occurrences and ``n_occ``, 
as well as a strong seed dependency.

It is important to notice than in order to determine the effective
investigation time, the engine takes into account also the ground motion
logic tree and the correct formula to use is

``eff_investigation_time = investigation_time * num_ses * num_rlzs``

where ``num_rlzs`` is the number of realizations in the 
ground motion logic tree.

Just to be concrete, if you run a calculation with the same parameters
as described before, but with two GMPEs instead of one (and
``number_of_logic_tree_samples = 0``), then the total number of paths
admitted by the logic tree will be 2 and you should expect to get
about twice the number of occurrences for each rupture.
Users wanting to know the nitty-gritty details should look at the
code, inside hazardlib/source/base.py, in the method
``src.sample_ruptures(eff_num_ses, ses_seed)``.

The difference between full enumeration and sampling
--------------------------------------------------------------

Users are often confused about the difference between full enumeration and
sampling. For this reason the engine distribution comes
with a pedagogical example that considers an extremely simplified situation
comprising a single site, a single rupture, and only two GMPEs.
You can find the example in the engine repository under the directory
`openquake/qa_tests_data/event_based/case_3`. If you look at the ground motion
logic tree file, the two GMPEs are AkkarBommer2010 (with weight 0.9)
and SadighEtAl1997 (with weight 0.1).

The parameters in the job.ini are::

 investigation_time = 1
 ses_per_logic_tree_path = 5_000
 number_of_logic_tree_paths = 0

Since there are 2 realizations, the effective investigation time is
10,000 years. If you run the calculation, you will generate (at least
with version 3.13 of the engine, though the details may change with the version)
10,121 events, since the occurrence rate of the rupture was chosen to be 1.
Roughly half of the events will be associated with the first GMPE
(AkkarBommer2010) and half with the second GMPE (SadighEtAl1997).
Actually, if you look at the test, the precise numbers will be
5,191 and 4,930 events, i.e. 51% and 49% rather than 50% and 50%, but this
is expected and by increasing the investigation time you can get closer
to the ideal equipartition. Therefore, even if the AkkarBommer2010 GMPE
is assigned a relative weight that is 9 times greater than SadighEtAl1997, 
*this is not reflected in the simulated event set*. 
It means that when performing a computation (for instance
to compute the mean ground motion field, or the average loss) one
has to keep the two realizations distinct, and only at the end to
perform the weighted average.

The situation is the opposite when sampling is used. In order to get the
same effective investigation time of 10,000 years you should change the
parameters in the job.ini to::

 investigation_time = 1
 ses_per_logic_tree_path = 1
 number_of_logic_tree_paths = 10_000

Now there are 10,000 realizations, not 2, and they *all have the same
weight .0001*. The number of events per realization is still roughly
constant (around 1) and there are still 10,121 events, however now *the
original weights are reflected in the event set*.  In particular there
are 9,130 events associated to the AkkarBommer2010 GMPE and 991 events
associated to the SadighEtAl1997 GMPE. There is no need to keep the realizations
separated: since they have all the same weigths, you can trivially
compute average quantities. AkkarBommer2010 will count more than SadighEtAl1997
simply because there are 9 times more events for it (actually 9130/991 = 9.2,
but the rate will tend to 9 when the effective time will tend to infinity).

NB: just to be clear, normally realizations are not in one-to-one
correspondence with GMPEs. In this example, it is true because there is
a single tectonic region type. However, usually there are multiple tectonic
region types, and a realization is associated to a tuple of GMPEs.

Rupture sampling: how to get it wrong
=====================================

Rupture samplings is *much more complex than one could expect* and in
many respects *surprising*. In the many years of existence of the
engine, multiple approached were tried and you can expect the
details of the rupture sampling mechanism to be different nearly at every
version of the engine.

Here we will discuss some tricky points that may help you understand
why different versions of the engine may give different results and also
why the comparison between the engine and other software performing
rupture sampling is nontrivial.

We will start with the first subtlety, the *interaction between
sampling and filtering*. The short version is that you should *first
sample and then filter*.

Here is the long version. Consider the following code emulating
rupture sampling for poissonian ruptures:

.. code-block::
  
  import numpy
  
  class FakeRupture:
      def __init__(self, mag, rate):
          self.mag = mag
          self.rate = rate
  
  def calc_n_occ(ruptures, eff_time, seed):
      rates = numpy.array([rup.rate for rup in ruptures])
      return numpy.random.default_rng(seed).poisson(rates * eff_time)
  
  mag_rates = [(5.0, 1e-5), (5.1, 2e-5), (5.2, 1e-5), (5.3, 2e-5),
               (5.4, 1e-5), (5.5, 2e-5), (5.6, 1e-5), (5.7, 2e-5)]
  fake_ruptures = [FakeRupture(mag, rate) for mag, rate in mag_rates]
  eff_time = 50 * 10_000
  seed = 42

Running this code will give you the following numbers of occurrence for the
8 ruptures considered:

.. code-block::

   >> calc_n_occ(fake_ruptures, eff_time, seed)
   [ 8  9  6 13  7  6  6 10]

Here we did not consider the fact that engine has a ``minimum_magnitude``
feature and it is able to discard ruptures below the minimum magnitude.
But how should it work? The natural approach to follow, for performance-oriented
applications, would be to first discard the low magnitudes and then perform
the sampling. However, that would have effects that would be surprising
for most users. Consider the following two alternative:

.. code-block::
  
  def calc_n_occ_after_filtering(ruptures, eff_time, seed, min_mag):
      mags = numpy.array([rup.mag for rup in ruptures])
      rates = numpy.array([rup.rate for rup in ruptures])
      return numpy.random.default_rng(seed).poisson(
          rates[mags >= min_mag] * eff_time)
  
  def calc_n_occ_before_filtering(ruptures, eff_time, seed, min_mag):
      mags = numpy.array([rup.mag for rup in ruptures])
      rates = numpy.array([rup.rate for rup in ruptures])
      n_occ = numpy.random.default_rng(seed).poisson(rates * eff_time)
      return n_occ[mags >= min_mag]
  
Most users would expect that removing a little number of ruptures has a
little effect; for instance, if we set ``min_mag = 5.1`` such that only
the first rupture is removed from the total 8 ruptures, we would expect
a minor change. However, if we follow the filter-early approach the user
would get completely different occupation numbers:

.. code-block::

   >> calc_n_occ_after_filtering(fake_ruptures, eff_time, seed, min_mag)
   [13  6  9  6 13  7  6]

It is only by using the filter-late approach that the occupation numbers
are consistent with the no-filtering case:

.. code-block::

    >> calc_n_occ_before_filtering(fake_ruptures, eff_time, seed, min_mag)
    [ 9  6 13  7  6  6 10]

The problem with the filtering is absolutely general and not restricted
only to the magnitude filtering: it is exactly the same also for distance
filtering. Suppose you have a ``maximum_distance`` of 300 km and than
you decide that you want to increase it to 301 km. One would expect this
change to have a minor impact; instead, you may end up sampling a very
different set of ruptures.

It is true that average quantities like the hazard curves obtained from
the ground motion fields will converge for long enough effective time,
however in practice you are always in situations were

1. you cannot perform the calculation for a long enough effective time
   since it would be computationally prohibitive
2. you are interested on quantities which are strongly sensitive to aany
   change, like the Maximum Probable Loss at some return period

In such situations changing the site collection (or changing
the maximum distance which is akin to changing the site collection)
can change the sampling of the ruptures significantly, at least for
engine versions lower than 3.17.

Users wanting to compare the GMFs or the risk on different site collections
should be aware of this effect; the solution is to first sample the
ruptures without setting any site collection (i.e. disabling the
filtering) and then perform the calculation with the site collection
starting from the sampled ruptures.

The problem is discussed also in the section about `Risk profiles`_
which discusses why you should not split the hazard calculation in
different countries when running a continental scale calculation.

Extra tips specific to event based calculations
===============================================

Event based calculations differ from classical calculations because
they produce visible ruptures, which can be exported and made
accessible to the user. In classical calculations, instead,
the underlying ruptures only live in memory and are normally not saved
in the datastore, nor are exportable. The limitation is fundamentally
a technical one: in the case of an event based calculation only a
small fraction of the ruptures contained in a source are actually
generated, so it is possible to store them. In a classical calculation
*all* ruptures are generated and there are so many millions of them
that it is impractical to save them, unless there are very few sites.
For this reason they live in memory, they are used to produce the
hazard curves and immediately discarded right after. The exception if
for the case of few sites, i.e. if the number of sites is less than
the parameter ``max_sites_disagg`` which by default is 10.


Convergency of the GMFs for non-trivial logic trees
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

In theory, the hazard curves produced by an event based calculation
should converge to the curves produced by an equivalent classical
calculation. In practice, if the parameters
``number_of_logic_tree_samples`` and ``ses_per_logic_tree_path`` (the
product of them is the relevant one) are not large enough they may be
different. The engine is able to compare
the mean hazard curves and to see how well they converge. This is
done automatically if the option ``mean_hazard_curves = true`` is set.
Here is an example of how to generate and plot the curves for one
of our QA tests (a case with bad convergence was chosen on purpose)::

 $ oq engine --run event_based/case_7/job.ini
 <snip>
 WARNING:root:Relative difference with the classical mean curves for IMT=SA(0.1): 51%
 WARNING:root:Relative difference with the classical mean curves for IMT=PGA: 49%
 <snip>
 $ oq plot /tmp/cl/hazard.pik /tmp/hazard.pik --sites=0,1,2

.. image:: ebcl-convergency.png

The relative difference between the classical and event based curves is
computed by computing the relative difference between each point of
the curves for each curve, and by taking the maximum, at least
for probabilities of exceedence larger than 1% (for low values of
the probability the convergency may be bad). For the details I
suggest you to look at the code.

The concept of "mean" ground motion field
============================================

The engine has at least three different kinds of *mean ground motion
field*, computed differently and used in different situations:

1. *Mean ground motion field by GMPE*, used to reduce disk space and
   make risk calculations faster.

2. *Mean ground motion field by event*, used for debugging/plotting
   purposes.

3. *Single-rupture hazardlib mean ground motion field*,
   used for analysis/plotting purposes.

Mean ground motion field by GMPE
--------------------------------

This is the most useful concept for people doing risk calculations.
To be concrete, suppose you are running a `scenario_risk` calculation
on a region where you have a very fine site model (say at 1 km
resolution) and a sophisticated hazard model (say with 16 different
GMPEs): then you can easily end up with a pretty large calculation.
For instance one of our users was doing such a calculation with an
exposure of 1.2 million assets, 50,000+ hazard sites, 5 intensity
measure levels and 1000 simulations, corresponding to 16,000 events
given that there are 16 GMPEs.  Given that each ground motion value
needs 4 bytes to be stored as a 32 bit float, the math tells us that
such calculation will generate 50000 x 16000 x 5 x 4 ~ 15 GB of data
(it could be a but less by using the ``minimum_intensity`` feature,
but you get the order of magnitude). This is very little for the
engine that can store such an amount of data in less than 1 minute,
but it is a huge amount of data for a database.  If you a
(re)insurance company and your workflow requires ingesting the GMFs in
a database to compute the financial losses, that's a big issue.  The
engine could compute the hazard in just an hour, but the risk part
could easily take 8 days. This is a no-go for most companies. They
have deadlines and cannot way 8 days to perform a single analysis. At
the end they are interested only in the mean losses, so they would
like to have a single effective mean field producing something close
to the mean losses that more correctly would be obtained by
considering all 16 realizations. With a single effective realization
the data storage would drop under 1 GB and more significantly the
financial model software would complete the calculation in 12 hours
instead of 8 days, something a lot more reasonable.

For this kind of situations hazardlib provides an ``AvgGMPE`` class,
that allows to replace a set of GMPEs with a single effective GMPE.
More specifically, the method ``AvgGMPE.get_means_and_stddevs``
calls the methods ``.get_means_and_stddevs`` on the underlying GMPEs
and performs a weighted average of the means and a weighted average
of the variances using the usual formulas:

.. math::

   \mu &= \Sigma_i w_i \mu_i \\
   \sigma^2 &= \Sigma_i w_i (\sigma_i)^2

where the weights sum up to 1. It is up to the user to check how big
is the difference in the risk between the complete calculation and
the mean field calculation. A factor of 2 discrepancies would not be
surprising, but we have also seen situations where there is no difference
within the uncertainty due to the random seed choice.


Mean ground motion field by event
---------------------------------

Using the `AvgGMPE` trick does not solve the issue of visualizing the
ground motion fields, since for each site there are still 1000 events.
A plotting tool has still to download 1 GB of data and then one has
to decide which event to plot. The situation is the same if you are
doing a sensitivity analysis, i.e. you are changing some parameter
(it could be a parameter of the underlying rupture, or even the random
seed) and you are studying how the ground motion fields change. It is
hard to compare two sets of data of 1 GB each. Instead, it is a lot
easier to define a "mean" ground motion field obtained by averaging
on the events and then compare the mean fields of the two calculations:
if they are very different, it is clear that the calculation is very
sensitive to the parameter being studied. Still, the tool performing the
comparison will need to consider 1000 times less data and will be
1000 times faster, also downloding 1000 times less data from the remote
server where the calculation has been performed.

For this kind of analysis the engine provides an internal output ``avg_gmf``
that can be plotted with the command ``oq plot avg_gmf <calc_id>``. It is
also possible to compare two calculations with the command

``$ oq compare avg_gmf imt <calc1> <calc2>``

Since ``avg_gmf`` is meant for internal usage and for debugging it is
not exported by default and it is not visible in the WebUI. It is also
not guaranteed to stay the same across engine versions. It is
available starting from version 3.11. It should be noted that,
consistently with how the ``AvgGMPE`` works, the ``avg_gmf`` output
*is computed in log space*, i.e. it is geometric mean, not the usual
mean. If the distribution was exactly lognormal that would also coincide
with the median field.

However, you should remember that in order to reduce
the data transfer and to save disk space the engine discards ground
motion values below a certain minimum intensity, determined explicitly
by the user or inferred from the vulnerability functions when
performing a risk calculation: there is no point in considering ground
motion values below the minimum in the vulnerability functions, since
they would generate zero losses. Discarding the values below the threshould
breaks the log normal distribution.

To be concrete, consider a case with a single site, and single intensity measure
type (PGA) and a ``minimum_intensity`` of 0.05g. Suppose there are 1000
simulations and that you have a normal distribution of the logaritms
with :math:`\mu`=-2 and :math:`\sigma`=.5; then the ground motion values that you could obtain
would be as follows:

>>> import numpy
>>> np.random.seed(42) # fix the seed
>>> gmvs = np.random.lognormal(mean=-2.0, sigma=.5, size=1000)

As expected, the variability of the values is rather large, spanning
more than one order of magnitude:

>>> numpy.round([gmvs.min(), np.median(gmvs), gmvs.max()], 6)
array([0.026766, 0.137058, 0.929011])

Also mean and standard deviation of the logarithms are very close to
the expected values :math:`\mu`=-2 and :math:`\sigma`=.5:

>>> round(np.log(gmvs).mean(), 6)
-1.990334
>>> round(np.log(gmvs).std(), 6)
0.489363

The geometric mean of the values (i.e. the exponential of the mean
of the logarithms) is very close to the median, as expected for a lognormal
distribution:

>>> round(np.exp(np.log(gmvs).mean()), 6)
0.13665

All these properties are broken when the ground motion values
are truncated below the ``minimum_intensity``::

 >> gmvs[gmvs < .05] = .05
 >> round(np.log(gmvs).mean(), 6)
 -1.987608
 >> round(np.log(gmvs).std(), 6)
 0.4828063
 >> round(np.exp(np.log(gmvs).mean()), 6)
 0.137023

In this case the difference is minor, but if the number of simulations
is small and/or the :math:`\sigma` is large the mean and standard
deviation obtained from the logarithms of the ground motion fields
could be quite different from the expected ones.

Finally, it should be noticed that the geometric mean can be orders of
magnitude different from the usual mean and it is purely a coincidence
that in this case they are close (~0.137 vs ~0.155).


Single-rupture estimated median ground motion field
---------------------------------------------------

The mean ground motion field by event discussed above is an *a posteriori*
output: *after* performing the calculation, some statistics are performed
on the stored ground motion fields. However, in the case of a single
rupture it is possible to estimate the geometric mean and the geometric
standard deviation  *a priori*, using hazardlib and without performing
a full calculation. However, there are some limitations to this approach:

1. it only works when there is a single rupture
2. you have to manage the ``minimum_intensity`` manually if you want to compare
   with a concrete engine output
3. it is good for estimates, it gives you the theoretical ground
   ground motion field but not the ones concretely generated by the
   engine fixed a specific seed

It should also be noticed that there is a shortcut to compute the
single-rupture hazardlib "mean" ground motion field without writing
any code; just set in your ``job.ini`` the following values::

  truncation_level = 0
  ground_motion_fields = 1

Setting ``truncation_level = 0`` effectively replaces the lognormal
distribution with a delta function, so the generated ground motion fields
will be all equal, with the same value for all events: this is why you
can set ``ground_motion_fields = 1``, since you would just waste time and space
by generating multiple copies.

Finally let's warn again on the term hazardlib "mean" ground motion
field: in log space it is truly a mean, but in terms of the original
GMFs it is a geometric mean - which is the same as the median since the
distribution is lognormal - so you can also call this the hazardlib
*median* ground motion field.

Case study: GMFs for California
-----------------------------------------

We had an user asking for the GMFs of California on 707,920 hazard sites,
using the UCERF mean model and an investigation time of 100,000 years.
Is this feasible or not? Some back of the envelope calculations
suggests that it is unfeasible, but reality can be different.

The relevant parameters are the following::

 N = 707,920 hazard sites
 E = 10^5 estimated events of magnitude greater then 5.5 in the investigation
     time of 100,000 years
 B = 1 number of branches in the UCERF logic tree
 G = 5 number of GSIMS in the GMPE logic tree
 I = 6 number of intensity measure types
 S1 = 13 number of bytes used by the engine to store a single GMV

The maximum size of generated GMFs is

``N * E * B * G * I * S1 = 25 TB (terabytes)``

Storing and sharing 25 TB of data is a big issue, so the problem seems
without solution. However, most of the ground motion values are zero,
because there is a maximum distance of 300 km and a rupture cannot
affect all of the sites. So the size of the GMFs should be less than
25 TB. Moreover, if you want to use such GMFs for a damage analysis,
you may want to discard very small shaking that will not cause any
damage to your buildings. The engine has a parameter to discard all
GMFs below a minimum threshold, the ``minimum_intensity`` parameter. The
higher the threshold, the smaller the size of the GMFs. By playing
with that parameter you can reduce the size of the output by orders of
magnitudes. Terabytes could easily become gigabytes with a well chosen
threshold.

In practice, we were able to run the full 707,920 sites by
splitting the sites in 70 tiles and by using a minimum intensity of 0.1 g. This
was the limit configuration for our cluster which has 5 machines with
128 GB of RAM each. 

The full calculation was completed in only 4 hours because our calculators
are highly optimized. The total size of the generated HDF5 files was
of 400 GB. This is a lot less than 25 TB, but still too large for sharing
purposes.

Another way to reduce the output is to reduce the number of intensity
measure types. Currently in your calculations there are 6 of them
(PGA, SA(0.1), SA(0.2), SA(0.5), SA(1.0), SA(2.0)) but if you restrict
yourself to only PGA the computation and the output will become 6
times smaller. Also, there are 5 GMPEs: if you restrict yourself to 1 GMPE
you gain a factor of 5. Similarly, you can reduce the investigation period
from 100,000 year to 10,000 years, thus gaining another order of magnitude.
Also, raising the minimum magnitude reduces the number of events significantly.

But the best approach is to be smart. For instance, we know from experience
that if the final goal is to estimate the total loss for a given exposure, the
correct way to do that is to aggregate the exposure on a smaller number of
hazard sites. For instance, instead of the original 707,920 hazard sites
we could aggregate on only ~7,000 hazard sites and we would a calculation
which is 100 times faster, produces 100 times less GMFs and still produces
a good estimate for the total loss.

In short, risk calculations for the mean field UCERF model are routines
now, in spite of what the naive expectations could be.

Extended consequences
=====================

Scenario damage calculations produce damage distributions, i.e. arrays
containing the number of buildings in each damage state defined in
the fragility functions. There is a damage distribution per each
asset, event and loss type, so you can easily produce *billions* of
damage distributions. This is why the engine provide facilities to
compute results based on aggregating the damage distributions,
possibly multiplied by suitable coefficients, i.e. *consequences*.

For instance, from the probability of being in the collapsed damage
state, one may estimate the number of fatalities, given the right
multiplicative coefficient.  Another commonly computed consequence is
the economic loss; in order to estimated it, one need a different
multiplicative coefficient for each damage state and for each
taxonomy. The table of coefficients, a.k.a. the *consequence model*,
can be represented as a CSV file like the following:

===================	============	============	========	==========	===========	==========	
 taxonomy          	 consequence  	 loss_type  	 slight 	 moderate 	 extensive 	 complete 	
-------------------	------------	------------	--------	----------	-----------	----------

===================	============	============	========	==========	===========	==========	

The first field in the header is the name of a tag in the exposure; in
this case it is the taxonomy but it could be any other tag â€” for instance,
for volcanic ash-fall consequences, the roof-type might be more relevant,
and for recovery time estimates, the occupancy class might be more relevant.

The consequence framework is meant to be used for generic consequences,
not necessarily limited to earthquakes, because since version 3.6 the engine
provides a multi-hazard risk calculator.

The second field of the header, the ``consequence``, is a string
identifying the kind of consequence we are considering. It is
important because it is associated to the name of the function
to use to compute the consequence. It is rather easy to write
an additional function in case one needed to support a new kind of
consequence. You can show the list of consequences by the version of
the engine that you have installed with the command::

 $ oq info consequences  # in version 3.12
 The following 5 consequences are implemented:
 losses
 collapsed
 injured
 fatalities
 homeless

The other fields in the header are the loss type and the damage states.
For instance the coefficient 0.25 for "moderate" means that the cost to
bring a structure in "moderate damage" back to its undamaged state is
25% of the total replacement value of the asset. The loss type refers
to the fragility model, i.e. ``structural`` will mean that the
coefficients apply to damage distributions obtained from the fragility
functions defined in the file ``structural_fragility_model.xml``.

discrete_damage_distribution
----------------------------

Damage distributions are called discrete when
the number of buildings in each damage is an integer, and continuous
when the number of buildings in each damage state is a floating point number.
Continuous distributions are a lot more efficient to compute and therefore
that is the default behavior of the engine, at least starting from version 3.13.
You can ask the engine to use discrete damage distribution by setting the
flag in the job.ini file

``discrete_damage_distribution = true``

However, it should be noticed that setting
``discrete_damage_distribution = true`` will raise an error if the
exposure contains a floating point number of buildings for some asset.
Having a floating point number of buildings in the exposure is quite
common since the "number" field is often estimated as an average.

Even if the exposure contains only integers and you have set
``discrete_damage_distribution = true`` in the job.ini, the
aggregate damage distributions will normally contains floating
point numbers, since they are obtained by summing integer distributions
for all seismic events of a given hazard realization
and dividing by the number of events of that realization.

By summing the number of buildings in each damage state one will
get the total number of buildings for the given aggregation level;
if the exposure contains integer numbers than the sum of the numbers
will be an integer, apart from minor differences due to numeric errors,
since the engine stores even discrete distributions as floating point numbers.


The EventBasedDamage demo
----------------------------------------------------------------

Given a source model, a logic tree, an exposure, a set of fragility functions
and a set of consequence functions, the ``event_based_damage`` calculator
is able to compute results such as average consequences and average
consequence curves. The ``scenario_damage`` calculator does the same,
except it does not start from a source model and a logic tree, but
rather from a set of predetermined ruptures or ground motion fields,
and the averages are performed on the input parameter
``number_of_ground_motion_fields`` and not on the effective investigation time.

In the engine distribution, in the folders ``demos/risk/EventBasedDamage``
and ``demos/risk/ScenarioDamage`` there are examples of how to use the
calculators.

Let's start with the EventBasedDamage demo. The source model, the
exposure and the fragility functions are much simplified and you should
not consider them realistic for the Nepal, but they permit very fast
hazard and risk calculations. The effective investigation time is

``eff_time = 1 (year) x 1000 (ses) x 50 (rlzs) = 50,000 years``

and the calculation is using sampling of the logic tree. 
Since all the realizations have the same weight, on
the risk side we can effectively consider all of them together. This is
why there will be a single output (for the effective risk realization)
and not 50 outputs (one for each hazard realization) as it would happen
for an ``event_based_risk`` calculation.

Normally the engine does not store the damage distributions for each
asset (unless you specify ``aggregate_by=id`` in the ``job.ini`` file).

By default it stores the aggregate damage distributions by summing on
all the assets in the exposure. If you are interested only in partial
sums, i.e. in aggregating only the distributions associated to a
certain tag combination, you can produce the partial sums by
specifying the tags.  For instance ``aggregate_by = taxonomy`` will
aggregate by taxonomy, ``aggregate_by = taxonomy, region`` will
aggregate by taxonomy and region, etc. The aggregated damage
distributions (and aggregated consequences, if any) will be stored in
a table called ``risk_by_event`` which can be accessed with
pandas. The corresponding DataFrame will have fields ``event_id``,
``agg_id`` (integer referring to which kind of aggregation you are
considering), ``loss_id`` (integer referring to the loss type in
consideration), a column named ``dmg_X`` for each damage state and a
column for each consequence.  In the EventBasedDamage demo the
exposure has a field called ``NAME_1`` and representing a geographic
region in Nepal (i.e.  "East" or "Mid-Western") and there is an
``aggregate_by = NAME_1, taxonomy`` in the ``job.ini``.

Since the demo has 4 taxonomies ("Wood", "Adobe", "Stone-Masonry",
"Unreinforced-Brick-Masonry") there 4 x 2 = 8 possible aggregations;
actually, there is also a 9th possibility corresponding to aggregating
on all assets by disregarding the tags. You can see the possible
values of the the ``agg_id`` field with the following command::

 $ oq show agg_id
                           taxonomy       NAME_1
 agg_id                                         
 0                             Wood         East
 1                             Wood  Mid-Western
 2                            Adobe         East
 3                            Adobe  Mid-Western
 4                    Stone-Masonry         East
 5                    Stone-Masonry  Mid-Western
 6       Unreinforced-Brick-Masonry         East
 7       Unreinforced-Brick-Masonry  Mid-Western
 8                         *total*      *total*

Armed with that knowledge it is pretty easy to understand the
``risk_by_event`` table::

 >> from openquake.commonlib.datastore import read
 >> dstore = read(-1)  # the latest calculation
 >> df = dstore.read_df('risk_by_event', 'event_id')
           agg_id  loss_id  dmg_1  dmg_2  dmg_3  dmg_4         losses
 event_id

 [8066 rows x 7 columns]

The number of buildings in each damage state is integer (even if stored as
a float) because the exposure contains only integers and the `job.ini`
is setting explicitly ``discrete_damage_distribution = true``.

It should be noted that while there is a CSV exporter for the ``risk_by_event``
table, it is designed to export only the total aggregation component (i.e.
``agg_id=9`` in this example) for reasons of backward compatibility with the
past, the time when the only aggregation the engine could perform was the
total aggregation. Since the ``risk_by_event`` table can be rather large, it is
recommmended to interact with it with pandas and not to export in CSV.

There is instead a CSV exporter for the aggregated damage
distributions (together with the aggregated consequences) that you may
call with the command ``oq export aggrisk``; you can also see the
distributions directly::

 $ oq show aggrisk
    agg_id  rlz_id  loss_id        dmg_0     dmg_1     dmg_2     dmg_3     dmg_4        losses

By summing on the damage states one gets the total number of buildings for each
aggregation level::

  agg_id dmg_0 + dmg_1 + dmg_2 + dmg_3 + dmg_4 aggkeys
  0        19.000039 ~ 19                      Wood,East

  5         2.000004 ~ 2                       Stone-Masonry,Mid-Western
  6       802.999853 ~ 803                     Unreinforced-Brick-Masonry,East
  7        48.999971 ~ 49                      Unreinforced-Brick-Masonry,Mid-Western
  8      1046.995130 ~ 1047                    Total


The ScenarioDamage demo
----------------------------------------------------------------

The demo in ``demos/risk/ScenarioDamage`` is similar to the
EventBasedDemo (it still refers to Nepal) but it uses a much large
exposure with 9063 assets and 5,365,761 building. Moreover the
configuration file is split in two: first you should run
``job_hazard.ini`` and then run ``job_risk.ini`` with the ``--hc`` option.

The first calculation will produce 2 sets of 100 ground motion fields
each (since ``job_hazard.ini`` contains
``number_of_ground_motion_fields = 100`` and the gsim logic tree file
contains two GMPEs). The second calculation will use such GMFs to
compute aggregated damage distributions. Contrarily to event based
damage calculations, scenario damage calculations normally use full
enumeration, since there are very few realizations (only two in this
example), thus the scenario damage calculator is able to distinguish
the results by realization.

The main output of a ``scenario_damage`` calculation is still the
``risk_by_event`` table which has exactly the same form as for the
EventBasedDamage demo. However there is a difference when
considering the ``aggrisk`` output: since we are using full enumeration
we will produce a damage distribution for each realization::

 $ oq show aggrisk
    agg_id  rlz_id  loss_id       dmg_0  ...  dmg_4        losses
 0       0       0        0  4173405.75  ...  452433.40625  7.779261e+09
 1       0       1        0  3596234.00  ...  633638.37500  1.123458e+10

The sum over the damage states will still produce the total number of
buildings, which will be independent from the realization::

 rlz_id dmg_0 + dmg_1 + dmg_2 + dmg_3 + dmg_4
 0      5365761.0
 1      5365761.0

In this demo there is no ``aggregate_by`` specified, so the only aggregation
which is performed is the total aggregation. You are invited to specify
``aggregate_by`` and study how ``aggrisk`` changes.

Taxonomy mapping
---------------------------------

In an ideal world, for every building type represented in the 
exposure model, there would be a unique matching function
in the vulnerability or fragility models. However, often it may
not be possible to have a one-to-one mapping of the taxonomy strings
in the exposure and those in the vulnerability or fragility models.
For cases where the exposure model has richer detail, many taxonomy
strings in the exposure would need to be mapped onto a single 
vulnerability or fragility function. In other cases where building
classes in the exposure are more generic and the fragility or vulnerability
functions are available for more specific building types, a modeller
may wish to assign more than one vulnerability or fragility function
to the same building type in the exposure with different weights.

We may encode such information into a `taxonomy_mapping.csv`
file like the following:

=========== ===========
taxonomy     conversion
----------- -----------
Wood Type A  Wood
Wood Type B  Wood
Wood Type C  Wood
=========== ===========

Using an external file is convenient, because we can avoid changing the
original exposure. If in the future we will be able to get specific
risk functions, then we will just remove the taxonomy mapping.
This usage of the taxonomy mapping (use proxies for missing risk
functions) is pretty useful, but there is also another usage which
is even more interesting.

Consider a situation where there are doubts about the precise
composition of the exposure. For instance we may know than in a given
geographic region 20% of the building of type "Wood" are of "Wood Type
A", 30% of "Wood Type B" and 50% of "Wood Type C", corresponding to
different risk functions, but do not know building per building
what it its precise taxonomy, so we just use a generic "Wood"
taxonomy in the exposure. We may encode the weight information into a
`taxonomy_mapping.csv` file like the following:

========= ============ =======
taxonomy   conversion   weight
--------- ------------ -------
Wood       Wood Type A  0.2
Wood       Wood Type B  0.3
Wood       Wood Type C  0.5
========= ============ =======

The engine will read this mapping file and when performing the risk calculation
will use all three kinds of risk functions to compute a single result
with a weighted mean algorithm. The sums of the weights must be 1
for each exposure taxonomy, otherwise the engine will raise an error.
In this case the taxonomy mapping file works like a risk logic tree.

Internally both the first usage and the second usage are treated in
the same way, since the first usage is a special case of the second
when all the weights are equal to 1.

Correlation of Ground Motion Fields
=========================================

There are multiple different kind of correlation on the engine, so it
is extremely easy to get confused. Here I will list all possibilities,
in historical order.

1. Spatial correlation of ground motion fields has been a feature of
   the engine from day one. The available models are JB2009 and HM2018.
2. Cross correlation in ShakeMaps has been available for a few years.
   The model used there is hard-coded an the user cannot change it,
   only disable it. The models list below (3. and 4.) *have no effect
   on ShakeMaps*.
3. Since version 3.13 the engine provides the BakerJayaram2008 cross
   correlation model, however at the moment it is used only in the conditional
   spectrum calculator.
4. Since version 3.13 the engine provides the GodaAtkinson2009 cross
   correlation model and the FullCrossCorrelation model which can be
   used in scenario and event based calculations.

Earthquake theory tells us that ground motion fields depend on two
different lognormal distributions with parameters (:math:`\mu`,
:math:`\tau`) and (:math:`\mu`, :math:`\phi`) respectively, which are
determined by the GMPE (Ground Motion Prediction Equal). Given a
rupture, a set of M intensity measure types and a collection of N
sites, the parameters :math:`\mu`, :math:`\tau` and :math:`\phi` are
arrays of shape (M, N). :math:`\mu` is the mean of the logarithms and
:math:`\tau` the between-event standard deviation, associated to the
cross correlation, while :math:`\phi` is the within-event standard
deviation, associated to the spatial correlation. math:`\tau` and
:math:`\phi` are normally N-independent, i.e.  each array of shape
(M, N) actually contains N copies of the same M values read from the
coefficient table of the GMPE.

In the OpenQuake engine each rupture has associated a random seed
generated from the parameter ``ses_seed`` given in the job.ini file,
therefore given a fixed number E of events it is possible to generate
a deterministic distribution of ground motion fields, i.e. an array of
shape (M, N, E). Technically such feature is implemented in the class
``openquake.hazardlib.calc.gmf.GmfComputer``. The algorithm used there
is to generate two arrays of normally distributed numbers called
:math:`\epsilon_\tau` (of shape (M, E)) and :math:`\epsilon_\phi` (of
shape (M, N, E)), one using the between-event standard deviation
:math:`\tau` and the other using the within-event standard deviation
:math:`\phi`, while keeping the same mean :math:`\mu`. Then the ground
motion fields are generated as an array of shape (M, N, E) with the
formula

.. math::

  gmf = exp(\mu + crosscorrel(\epsilon_\tau) + spatialcorrel(\epsilon\phi))

The details depend on the form of the cross correlation model and of
the spatial correlation model and you have to study the source code if
you really want to understand how it works, in particular how the
correlation matrices are extracted from the correlation models. By
default, if no cross correlation nor spatial correlation are
specified, then there are no correlation matrices and
:math:`crosscorrel(\epsilon_\tau)` and
:math:`spatialcorrel(\epsilon\phi)` are computed by using
``scipy.stats.truncnorm``. Otherwise
``scipy.stats.multivariate_normal`` with a correlation
matrix of shape (M, M) is used for cross correlation and
``scipy.stats.multivariate_normal`` distribution with a
matrix of shape (N, N) is used for spatial correlation. Notice that the
truncation feature is lost if you use correlation, since scipy does
not offer at truncated multivariate_normal distribution. Not truncating
the normal distribution can easily generated non-physical fields, but
even if the truncation is on it is very possible to generate exceedingly
large ground motion fields, so the user has to be *very* careful.

Correlation is important because its presence normally causes the risk to
increase, i.e. ignoring the correlation will under-estimate
the risk. The best way to play with the correlation is to consider a
scenario_risk calculation with a single rupture and to change the
cross and spatial correlation models. Possibilities are to specify
in the job.ini all possible combinations of

cross_correlation = FullCrossCorrelation
cross_correlation = GodaAtkinson2009
ground_motion_correlation_model = JB2009
ground_motion_correlation_model = HM2018

including removing one or the other or all correlations.


Scenarios from ShakeMaps
========================

Beginning with version 3.1, the engine is able to perform `scenario_risk`
and `scenario_damage` calculations starting from the GeoJSON feed for
ShakeMaps_ provided by the United States Geological Survey (USGS). 
Furthermore, starting from version 3.12 it is possible to use 
ShakeMaps from other sources like the local filesystem or a custom URL.

.. _ShakeMaps: https://earthquake.usgs.gov/data/shakemap/

Running the Calculation
-----------------------

In order to enable this functionality one has to prepare a parent
calculation containing the exposure and risk functions for the
region of interest, say Peru. To that aim the user will need
to write a `prepare_job.ini` file like this one::

   [general]
   description = Peru - Preloading exposure and vulnerability
   calculation_mode = scenario
   exposure_file = exposure_model.xml
   structural_vulnerability_file = structural_vulnerability_model.xml

By running the calculation

  ``$ oq engine --run prepare_job.ini``

The exposure and the risk functions will be imported in the datastore.

This example only includes vulnerability functions for the loss type
``structural``, but one could also have in this preparatory job file the 
functions for nonstructural components and contents, and occupants, 
or fragility functions if damage calculations are of interest.

It is essential that each fragility/vulnerability function in the risk
model should be conditioned on one of the intensity measure types that 
are supported by the ShakeMap service â€“ MMI, PGV, PGA, SA(0.3), SA(1.0), 
and SA(3.0). If your fragility/vulnerability functions involves an intensity
measure type which is not supported by the ShakeMap system
(for instance SA(0.6)) the calculation will terminate with an error.

Let's suppose that the calculation ID of this 'pre' calculation is 1000.
We can now run the risk calculation starting from a ShakeMap.
For that, one need a `job.ini` file like the following::

   [general]
   description = Peru - 2007 M8.0 Pisco earthquake losses
   calculation_mode = scenario_risk
   number_of_ground_motion_fields = 10
   truncation_level = 3
   shakemap_id = usp000fjta
   spatial_correlation = yes
   cross_correlation = yes

This example refers to the 2007 Mw8.0 Pisco earthquake in Peru
(see https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/eventpage/usp000fjta#shakemap).
The risk can be computed by running the risk job file against the prepared
calculation::

  $ oq engine --run job.ini --hc 1000

Starting from version 3.12 it is also possible to specify the following sources
instead of a `shakemap_id`::

   # (1) from local files:
   shakemap_uri = {
         "kind": "usgs_xml",
         "grid_url": "relative/path/file.xml",
         "uncertainty_url": "relative/path/file.xml"
         }

   # (2) from remote files:
   shakemap_uri = {
         "kind": "usgs_xml",
         "grid_url": "https://url.to/grid.xml",
         "uncertainty_url": "https://url.to/uncertainty.zip"
         }
   
   # (3) both files in a single archive
   # containing grid.xml, uncertainty.xml:
   shakemap_uri = {
         "kind": "usgs_xml",
         "grid_url": "relative/path/grid.zip" 
         }

While it is also possible to define absolute paths, it is advised not to do
so since using absolute paths will make your calculation not portable
across different machines.

The files must be valid `.xml` USGS ShakeMaps `(1)`. One or both files can
also be passed as `.zip` archives containing a single valid xml ShakeMap
`(2)`. If both files are in the same `.zip`, the archived files `must` be
named ``grid.xml`` and ``uncertainty.xml``.

Also starting from version 3.12 it is possible to use ESRI Shapefiles
in the same manner as ShakeMaps. Polygons define areas with the same
intensity levels and assets/sites will be associated to a polygon if
contained by the latter. Sites outside of a polygon will be
discarded. Shapefile inputs can be specified similar to ShakeMaps::

   shakemap_uri = {
      "kind": "shapefile",
      "fname": "path_to/file.shp"
   }

It is only necessary to specify one of the available files, and the rest of the files
will be expected to be in the same location. It is also possible to have them
contained together in a `*.zip` file.
There are at least a `*.shp`-main file and a `*.dbf`-dBASE file required. The 
record field names, intensity measure types and units all need to be the same 
as with regular USGS ShakeMaps.

Irrespective of the input, the engine will perform the following operations:

1. download the ShakeMap and convert it into a format
   suitable for further processing, i.e. a ShakeMaps array with lon, lat fields
2. the ShakeMap array will be associated to the hazard sites in the region
   covered by the ShakeMap
3. by using the parameters ``truncation_level`` and
   ``number_of_ground_motion_fields`` a set of ground motion fields (GMFs)
   following the truncated Gaussian distribution will be generated and stored
   in the datastore
4. a regular risk calculation will be performed by using such GMFs and the
   assets within the region covered by the shakemap.

Correlation
-----------

By default the engine tries to compute both the spatial correlation and the
cross correlation between different intensity measure types. Please note that 
if you are using MMI as intensity measure type in your vulnerability model,
it is not possible to apply correlations since those are based on physical measures.

For each kind of correlation you have three choices, that you can set in the 
`job.ini`, for a total of nine combinations::

- spatial_correlation = yes, cross_correlation = yes  # the default
- spatial_correlation = no, cross_correlation = no   # disable everything
- spatial_correlation = yes, cross_correlation = no
- spatial_correlation = no, cross_correlation = yes
- spatial_correlation = full, cross_correlation = full
- spatial_correlation = yes, cross_correlation = full
- spatial_correlation = no, cross_correlation = full
- spatial_correlation = full, cross_correlation = no
- spatial_correlation = full, cross_correlation = yes

`yes` means using the correlation matrix of the Silva-Horspool_ paper;
`no` mean using no correlation; `full` means using an 
all-ones correlation matrix.

.. _Silva-Horspool: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/eqe.3154

Apart from performance considerations, disabling either the spatial correlation 
or the cross correlation (or both) might be useful to see how significant the 
effect of the correlation is on the damage/loss estimates.

In particular, due to numeric errors, the spatial correlation matrix - that
by construction contains only positive numbers - can still produce small
negative eigenvalues (of the order of -1E-15) and the calculation fails
with an error message saying that the correlation matrix is not positive
defined. Welcome to the world of floating point approximation!
Rather than magically discarding negative eigenvalues the engine raises
an error and the user has two choices: either disable the spatial correlation
or reduce the number of sites because that can make the numerical instability
go away. The easiest way to reduce the number of sites is setting a
`region_grid_spacing` parameter in the `prepare_job.ini` file, then the
engine will automatically put the assets on a grid. The larger the grid
spacing, the fewer the number of points, and the closer the calculation
will be to tractability.

Performance Considerations
--------------------------

The performance of the calculation will be crucially determined by the number
of hazard sites. For instance, in the case of the Pisco earthquake
the ShakeMap has 506,142 sites, which is a significantly large number of sites.
However, the extent of the ShakeMap in longitude and latitude is about 6
degrees, with a step of 10 km the grid contains around 65 x 65 sites;
most of the sites are without assets because most of the
grid is on the sea or on high mountains, so actually there are
around ~500 effective sites. Computing a correlation matrix of size
500 x 500 is feasible, so the risk computation can be performed.

Clearly in situations in which the number of hazard sites is too
large, approximations will have to be made such as using a larger
`region_grid_spacing`.  Disabling spatial AND cross correlation makes
it possible run much larger calculations. The performance can be
further increased by not using a ``truncation_level``.

When applying correlation, a soft cap on the size of the calculations
is defined. This is done and modifiable through the parameter
``cholesky_limit`` which refers to the number of sites multiplied by
the number of intensity measure types used in the vulnerability
model. Raising that limit is at your own peril, as you might run out
of memory during calculation or may encounter instabilities in the
calculations as described above.

If the ground motion values or the standard deviations are particularly
large, the user will get a warning about suspicious GMFs.

Moreover, especially for old ShakeMaps, the USGS can provide them in a
format that the engine cannot read.

Thus, this feature is not expected to work in all cases.


Reinsurance calculations
========================

Starting from engine 3.16 reinsurance loss estimates for traditional property 
contracts are available for event-based and scenario risk calculations. 

The current implementation considers multiple layers of both proportional and
non-proportional treaties.

**Proportional treaties (Pro-Rata)**

- Quota Share
- Surplus
- Facultative

*NOTE: proportional treaties may have a parameter "max_cession_event"
limiting the total losses per event that can be ceded to the
reinsurer. The excess of loss generated
by events that exceed the maximum cession per event (overspill losses)
is going back to the insurer.*

**Non-proportional treaties**

- Working excess of loss per risk, WXL/R (``wxlr``).
  The unit of loss under this treaty is the "risk". The engine
  aggregates the losses per "risk" at the policy level, which
  can include single or multiple assets.
- Catastrophic excess of loss per event, CatXL (``catxl``).
  The unit of loss under this treaty is the "event".

- When combined with *proportional* treaties, the
  *non-proportional* layers are applied over the net loss
  retention coming from the proportional layers;
  first the ``wxlr`` are estimated, and then the successive layers
  of CatXL are applied over the net loss retention
        
*NOTE: The CatXL is applied over the net loss retention per event
coming from the proportional layers and therefore it includes the
overspill losses.*

Reinsurance calculations provide, in addition to the ground up losses, 
the losses allocated to different treaties  during a single event or 
during multiple events over a given time window.
Outputs include average losses and aggregated loss curves at policy and 
portfolio level for the retention and cession under the different treaties.

Input files
------------

To run reinsurance calculations, in addition to the required files for
performing event-based or scenario risk calculations, it is required to adjust
the exposure information, and to include two additional files:

1. Reinsurance information: an ``.xml`` file defining the characteristics of
   the reinsurance treaties (e.g., "reinsurance.xml").
2. Policy information: a ``.csv`` file with details of each policy
   indicated in the exposure model and the associated reinsurance
   treaties (e.g., "policy.csv").

The insurance information includes the allocation of assets into a given policy, 
the liability and the deductible. The deductible can be defined at asset level
(therefore indicated in the exposure model ``csv`` file), or in at the policy level
(therefore indicated in the policy ``csv`` file).
The current implementation only supports liability at policy level.

Exposure file
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The exposure input file (csv and xml with metadata) needs to be adjusted
to include a ``policy`` tag that indicates the type of policy 
(and therefore the reinsurance contracts) associated with each asset.

Policies can be defined for single or multiple assets. When multiple assets 
are allocated to the same policy, losses are aggregated at the policy level
before applying the insurance and reinsurance deductions. 

Below we present an example of an exposure model considering the
policy information and its associated metadata:

``exposure.xml``

.. code-block:: xml

    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
    <nrml xmlns="http://openquake.org/xmlns/nrml/0.4">
      <exposureModel id="ex1" category="buildings" taxonomySource="GEM taxonomy">

        <assets>
          exposure_model.csv
        </assets>
      </exposureModel>
    </nrml>

This example presents 7 assets (a1 to a7) with 4 associated policies.
Notice that the column ``policy`` is mandatory, as 
well as the line ``<tagNames>policy</tagNames>`` in
the xml. Additional tags can be included as needed.

Starting from OpenQuake 3.17, the exposure module can also include 
deductibles at asset level (called ``ideductible``).
In this case, the deductions are applied at asset level, and later
aggregated at the policy level before applying the liability and 
reinsurance allocations.

*NOTE: It is not possible to have a policy with ``ideductible`` at asset
and ``deductible`` at policy level. The engine only accepts one value.*


Insurance and reinsurance information (``reinsurance.xml``)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The insurance and reinsurance information is defined by a ``reinsurance.xml`` 
that includes the metadata and treaty characteristics for each treaty
specified in the policy information. 

The following example facilitates the understanding of the 
input file:

.. code-block:: xml

    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
    <nrml xmlns="http://openquake.org/xmlns/nrml/0.5"
          xmlns:gml="http://www.opengis.net/gml">
      <reinsuranceModel>
        <description>reinsurance model</description>

        <fieldMap>
          <field oq="liability" input="Limit" />
          <field oq="deductible" input="Deductible" />

          <field input="treaty_1" type="prop" max_cession_event="400" />
          <field input="treaty_2" type="prop" max_cession_event="400" />
          <field input="xlr1" type="wxlr" deductible="200" limit="1000" />
        </fieldMap>
      <policies>policy.csv</policies>
      </reinsuranceModel>
    </nrml>

**reinsurance.xml parameters:**

The reinsurance information must include, at least, a ``<description>`` and  
a list of files that contain the ``<policies>``. The ``<fieldMap>`` block 
is used to define the reinsurance treaties and their parameters.

The ``oq`` and ``input`` parameters are used to specify the *key* used
in the engine (``oq``) and its equivalent column header in the policy
file (``input``).  All reinsurance calculations must include, at least, 
the insurance characteristics of each policy: liability and deductible
(that can be at asset or policy level, depending on the portfolio characteristics). 
Then, the definition of reinsurance treaties depends on the
treaty type: proportional or non proportional.

*Proportional* treaties are identified by the parameter
``type="prop"``.  The fraction of losses ceded to each treaty is
specified for each policy covered by the treaty, and the retention is
calculated as 1 minus all the fractions specified in the multiple
layers of proportional treaties. For each proportional treaty it is
possible to define the ``max_cession_event``.

*Non-proportional* treaties are identified by the parameter
``type="wxlr"`` or ``type="catxl"``. For each treaty it is required to
indicate the ``deductible`` and ``limit``.

*Note: treaties must be written in a given order, keeping proportional
ones first, then non-proportional ones of type "wxlr" and finally those
of type "catxl".*

- **insurance deductible**: the amount (economic value) that the insurer will
  "deduct" from the ground up losses before paying up to its policy
  limits. The units of the deductible must be compatible with
  the units indicated in the exposure model (e.g. USD dollars or Euros).
  The deductible can be specified at policy (``deductible``) or asset level
  (``ideductible``) depending on the insurance contract.
  
  The claim is calculated as ``claim = ground_up_loss - deductible`` for
  policies with deductibles defined at the policy level, or
  ``claim = ground_up_loss - ideductible`` 
  for policies with deductibles defined at the asset level.


- **insurance liability**: the maximum economic amount that can be covered by
  the insurance, according to the policy characteristics. The
  liability is also known as limit or maximum coverage.

- **type**: parameter that specifies the type of treaty. There are
  three supported types: ``prop`` (for proportional treaties),
  ``wxlr``, or ``catxl``.

- **max_cession_event**: the maximum cession per event is an optional
  parameter for *proportional* reinsurance treaties. It refers to the
  maximum cession accepted by the reinsurance company for the
  aggregated losses produced by a single event.  If the aggregated
  losses exceed this threshold, then the cession in excess is reported
  as an ``overspill``.

- **reinsurance deductible**: only applicable to *non-proportional*
  treaties, the maximum retention (also known as "first loss") is the
  limit above which the reinsurer becomes liable for losses up to the
  upper limit of cover.

- **reinsurance limit**: in *non-proportional* treaties it refers to
  the upper limit of cover or ceiling.  The *reinsurance_cover* is the
  amount between the ``deductible`` (deductible) and the upper limit
  of cover.

*Note: the current engine implementation does not support an "annual
aggregate limit" for non-proportional reinsurance treaties.*


Policy information (``policy.csv``)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The policy input file indicates, for each policy, the insurance values 
(deductible and liability), as well as the reinsurance contracts associated 
with each policy present in the exposure model.

For **proportional** treaties, the values indicated in each columns refer
to the fraction of cession under the reinsurance treaty. On the other hand, 
for **non-proportional** treaties, the values are indicates as 1 for policies
covered within the treaty and zero when they are not part of the treaty.

The table below presents an example of the four policies indicated in the example
of the exposure model and the reinsurance presented above:

``policy.csv``

    +--------+-----------+------------+----------+----------+------+
    | policy | Limit     | Deductible | treaty_1 | treaty_2 | xlr1 |
    +========+===========+============+==========+==========+======+
    | p1_a1  | 2000      | 400        | 0.1      | 0.2      | 1    |
    +--------+-----------+------------+----------+----------+------+
    | p1_a2  | 1000      | 200        | 0.3      | 0.1      | 1    |
    +--------+-----------+------------+----------+----------+------+
    | p1_a3  | 1000      | 100        | 0        | 0.7      | 1    |
    +--------+-----------+------------+----------+----------+------+
    | p2     | 2000      | 500        | 0        | .4       | 1    |
    +--------+-----------+------------+----------+----------+------+

The ``policy`` column must contain the same identifiers as the ones specified
by the ``policy`` field in the exposure model.

In this example the ``Limit`` corresponds to the ``liability`` of each policy, while
the ``Deductible`` refers to the ``deductible`` in the engine. Both columns indicate
the absolute values using the same units as the exposed values in the exposure model.
There are two proportional reinsurance treaties (namely ``QuotaShare`` and ``Surplus``),
and the values indicated in each column represent the fraction of cession under each treaty.
For example, for "pol_1" the "QuotaShare" ceeds 0.1 of the losses and there is no cession
under the "Surplus" treaty; therefore the retention corresponding to the proportional 
treaties for "pol_1" will be (1 - 0.1 - 0. = 0.9).
In the case of non-proportional treaties, "pol_1" is allocated to the ``WXLR``
(an excess of loss per risk) treaty, and to the ``CatXL1`` (a catastrophic excess of
loss per event) treaty. This policy is not covered by the ``CatXL2`` treaty.

*Note: treaties must be written in a given order, keeping proportional
ones first, then non-proportional ones of type "wxlr" and finally those
of type "catxl".*

Configuration file ``job.ini``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Reinsurance losses can be calculated for event-based and scenario risk calculations.
To do so, the configuration file, ``job.in``, needs to specify the parameters
presented below, in addition to the parameters generally indicated for these type of 
calculations::

	[risk_calculation]
	aggregate_by = policy
	reinsurance_file = {'structural+contents': 'reinsurance.xml'}
	total_losses = structural+contents

**Additional comments:**

- ``aggregate_by``: it is possible to define multiple aggregation keys
  (see :ref:`aggregating_by_multiple_tags`).
  However, for reinsurance calculations the ``policy`` key must be present,
  otherwise an error message will be raised.
  In the following example, multiple aggregation keys are used:

      ``aggregate_by = policy; tag1``

  In this case, aggregated loss curves will be produced also for ``tag1`` and ``policy``,
  while reinsurance outputs will only be produced for the policy.

- ``reinsurance_file``: This dictionary associates the reinsurance information
  to a given the loss_type (the engine supports structural, nonstructural, 
  contents or its sum). The insurance and reinsurance calculations are applied 
  over the indicated loss_types, i.e. to the sum of the ground up losses 
  associated with the specified loss_types.

  *NOTE: The current implementation works only with a single reinsurance file.*

- ``total_losses``: (or total exposed value) needs to be specified when the reinsurance
  needs to be applied over the sum of two or more loss types (e.g. ``structural+contents``).
  The definition of total losses is also reflected in the risk outputs of the calculation.
  NB: if there is a single loss type (e.g. ``structural``) there is no need to specify
  this parameter, just write ``reinsurance_file = {'structural': 'reinsurance.xml'}``

Output files
------------

The reinsurance calculations generates estimates of retention and cession under the different
reinsurance treaties. The following output files are produced:

1. ``Reinsurance by event``: aggregated estimated per event for the claim, retention, 
   cession and overspills under each reinsurance treaty.

   +----------+-----------+---------+----------+----------+---------+--------------------+------+
   | event_id | retention | claim   | treaty_1 | treaty_2 | xlr1    | overspill_treaty_2 | year |

   +----------+-----------+---------+----------+----------+---------+--------------------+------+

2. ``Reinsurance curves``: reinsurance loss exceedance curves describe the probabilities
   of exceeding a set of loss ratios or loss values, within a given time span 
   (or investigation interval). The curves are generated for the claim, retention, 
   cession and overspills under each reinsurance treaty.

   +--------+---------------+-----------+---------+----------+----------+---------+--------------------+
   | rlz_id | return_period | retention | claim   | treaty_1 | treaty_2 | xlr1    | overspill_treaty_2 |

3. ``Average reinsurance losses``: the average reinsurance losses
   indicates the expected value within the time period specified
   by risk_investigation_time for the claim, retention, and

The parameters indicated in the previous outputs include:

- ``policy``: identifier of the unique policies indicated in the
  exposure model and policy files.

- ``claim``: ground up losses minus the deductible and up to the policy liability.

- ``retention``: net losses that the insurance company keeps for its own account.

- ``cession_i``: net losses that are ceded by the insurance company to
  the reinsurer(s) under treaty i. The cession is indicated by the
  treaty name defined in the reinsurance information.

- ``overspill_treaty_i``: net losses that exceed the maximum cession
  per event ("max_cession_event") for *proportional* and/or *catxl*
  treaties.

*NOTE: The sum of the claim is not equal to the ground up losses, since
usually the deductible is nonzero. Moreover there could be
"non-insured" losses corresponding to policies with no insurance
contracts or that exceed the policy liability.*


How the hazard sites are determined
===================================

There are several ways to specify the hazard sites in an engine calculation.

1. The user can specify the sites directly in the job.ini using the ``sites``
   parameter (e.g. ``sites = -122.4194 37.7749, -118.2437 34.0522, -117.1611 32.7157``).
   This method is perhaps most useful when the analysis is limited to a 
   handful of sites.
2. Otherwise the user can specify the list of sites in a CSV file
   (i.e. ``sites_csv = sites.csv``).
3. Otherwise the user can specify a grid via the ``region`` and
   ``region_grid_spacing`` parameters.
4. Otherwise the sites can be inferred from the exposure, if any,
   in two different ways:
   
   1. if ``region_grid_spacing`` is specified, a grid is implicitly
      generated from the convex hull of the exposure and used
   2. otherwise the locations of the assets are used as hazard sites
   
5. Otherwise the sites can be inferred from the site model file, if any.

It must be noted that the engine rounds longitudes and latitudes	
to 5 decimal places (or approximately 1 meter spatial resolution),
so sites that differ only at the 6th decimal place or beyond will
end up being considered as duplicated sites by the engine, and 
this will be flagged as an error.

Having determined the sites, a ``SiteCollection`` object is generated
by associating the closest parameters from the site model (if any)
or using the global site parameters, if any.
If the site model is specified, but the closest site parameters are 
too distant from the sites, a warning is logged for each site.

It is possible to specify both ``sites.csv`` and ``site_model.csv``:
in that case the sites in ``sites.csv`` are used, with parameters inferred
from the closest site model parameters.

There are a number of error situations:

1. If both site model and global site parameters are missing, the engine
   raises an error.
2. If both site model and global site parameters are specified, the
   engine raises an error.
3. Specifying both the sites.csv and a grid is an error.
4. Having duplicates (i.e. rows with identical lon, lat up to 5 digits)
   in the site model is an error.

If you want to compute the hazard on the locations specified by the site model
and not on the exposure locations, you can split the calculation in two files:
``job_haz.ini`` containing the site model and ``job_risk.ini`` containing the
exposure. Then the risk calculator will find the closest hazard to each
asset and use it. However, if the closest hazard is more distant than the
``asset_hazard_distance`` parameter (default 15 km) an error is raised.


Risk profiles
=============

The OpenQuake engine can produce risk profiles, i.e. estimates of average losses
and maximum probable losses for all countries in the world. Even if you
are interested in a single country, you can still use this feature
to compute risk profiles for each province in your country.

However, the calculation of the risk profiles is tricky and there are
actually several different ways to do it.

1. The least-recommended way is to run independent calculations, one
   for each country. The issue with this approach is that even if the
   hazard model is the same for all the countries (say you are
   interested in the 13 countries of South America), due to the nature
   of event based calculations, different ruptures will be sampled in
   different countries. In practice, when comparing Chile with Peru you will
   see differences due to the fact that the random sampling picked
   different ruptures in the two contries and not real differences. In
   theory, the effect should disappear if the calculations have sufficiently
   long investigation times, when all possible ruptures are sampled, 
   but in practice, for finite investigation times there will always be 
   different ruptures.

2. To avoid such issues, the country-specific calculations should
   ideally all start from the same set of precomputed ruptures. You can
   compute the whole stochastic event set by running an event based
   calculation without specifying the sites and with the parameter
   ``ground_motion_fields`` set to false. Currently, one must specify
   a few global site parameters in the precalculation to make the
   engine checker happy, but they will not be used since the
   ground motion fields will not be generated in the
   precalculation. The ground motion fields will be generated on-the-fly  
   in the subsequent individual country calculations, but not stored 
   in the file system. This approach is fine if you do not have a lot of disk
   space at your disposal, but it is still inefficient since it is
   quite prone to the slow tasks issue.

3. If you have plenty of disk space it is better to also generate the
   ground motion fields in the precalculation, and then run the
   contry-specific risk calculations starting from there. This is
   particularly convenient if you foresee the need to run the risk
   part of the calculations multiple times, while the hazard part remains
   unchanged. Using a precomputed set of GMFs removes the need to rerun
   the hazard part of the calculations each time. This workflow has
   been particularly optimized since version 3.16 of the engine and it is
   now quite efficient.

4. If you have a really powerful machine, the simplest is to
   run a single calculation considering all countries in a single
   job.ini file. The risk profiles can be obtained by using the
   ``aggregate_by`` and ``reaggregate_by`` parameters. This approach
   can be much faster than the previous ones. However, approaches #2
   and #3 are cloud-friendly and can be preferred if you have access
   to cloud-computing resources, since then you can spawn a different
   machine for each country and parallelize horizontally.

Here are some tips on how to prepare the required job.ini files:

When using approach #1 you will have 13 different files (in the example
of South America) with a format like the following::

 $ cat job_Argentina.ini
 calculation_mode = event_based_risk
 source_model_logic_tree_file = ssmLT.xml
 gsim_logic_tree_file = gmmLTrisk.xml
 site_model_file = Site_model_Argentina.csv
 exposure_file = Exposure_Argentina.xml
 ...
 $ cat job_Bolivia.ini
 calculation_mode = event_based_risk
 source_model_logic_tree_file = ssmLT.xml
 gsim_logic_tree_file = gmmLTrisk.xml
 site_model_file = Site_model_Bolivia.csv
 exposure_file = Exposure_Bolivia.xml
 ...

Notice that the ``source_model_logic_tree_file`` and ``gsim_logic_tree_file``
will be the same for all countries since the hazard model is the same;
the same sources will be read 13 times and the ruptures will be sampled
and filtered 13 times. This is inefficient. Also, hazard parameters like

::

 truncation_level = 3
 investigation_time = 1
 number_of_logic_tree_samples = 1000
 ses_per_logic_tree_path = 100
 maximum_distance = 300

must be the same in all 13 files to ensure the consistency of the
calculation. Ensuring this consistency can be prone to human error.

When using approach #2 you will have 14 different files: 13 files for
the individual countries and a special file for precomputing the ruptures::

 $ cat job_rup.ini 
 calculation_mode = event_based
 source_model_logic_tree_file = ssmLT.xml
 gsim_logic_tree_file = gmmLTrisk.xml
 reference_vs30_value = 760
 reference_depth_to_1pt0km_per_sec = 440
 ground_motion_fields = false
 ...

The files for the individual countries will be as before, except for
the parameter ``source_model_logic_tree_file`` which should be
removed. That will avoid reading 13 times the same source model files,
which are useless anyway, since the calculation now starts from
precomputed ruptures. There are still a lot of repetitions in the
files and the potential for making mistakes.

Approach #3 is very similar to approach #2: the only differences will be
in the initial file, the one used to precompute the GMFs. Obviously it
will require setting ``ground_motion_fields = true``; moreover, it will
require specifying the full site model as follows::

  site_model_file =
    Site_model_Argentina.csv
    Site_model_Bolivia.csv
    ...

The engine will automatically concatenate the site model files for all
13 countries and produce a single site collection. The site parameters
will be extracted from such files, so the dummy global parameters
``reference_vs30_value``, ``reference_depth_to_1pt0km_per_sec``, etc
can be removed.

It is FUNDAMENTAL FOR PERFORMANCE to have reasonable site model files,
i.e. you should not compute the hazard at the location of every single asset,
but rather you should use a variable-size grid fitting the exposure.

The engine provides a command ``oq prepare_site_model``
which is meant to generate sensible site model files starting from
the country exposures and the global USGS vs30 grid.
It works by using a hazard grid so that the number of sites
can be reduced to a manageable number. Please refer to the manual in
the section about the oq commands to see how to use it, or try
``oq prepare_site_model --help``.

For reference, we were able to compute the hazard for all of South
America on a grid of half million sites and 1 million years of effective time
in a few hours in a machine with 120 cores, generating half terabyte of GMFs.
The difficult part is avoiding running out memory when running the risk
calculation; huge progress in this direction was made in version 3.16 of
the engine.

Approach #4 is the best, when applicable, since there is only a single file,
thus avoiding entirely the possibily of having inconsistent parameters
in different files. It is also the faster approach, not to mention the
most convenient one, since you have to manage a single calculation and
not 13. That makes the task of managing any kind of post-processing a lot
simpler. Unfortunately, it is also the option that requires more
memory and it can be infeasable if the model is too large and you do not
have enough computing resources. In that case your best bet might be to
go back to options #2 or #3. If you have access to multiple small machines,
approaches #2 and #3 can be more attractive than #4, since then you 
can scale horizontally. If you decide to use approach #4, 
in the single file you must specify the ``site_model_file`` as done in
approach #3, and also the ``exposure_file`` as follows::

 exposure_file =
   Exposure_Argentina.xml
   Exposure_Bolivia.xml
   ...

The engine will automatically build a single asset collection for the
entire continent of South America. In order to use this approach, you
need to collect all the vulnerability functions in a single file and
the taxonomy mapping file must cover the entire exposure for all
countries.  Moreover, the exposure must contain the associations
between asset<->country; in GEM's exposure models, this is typically
encoded in a field called ``ID_0``. Then the aggregation by country
can be done with the option

::

   aggregate_by = ID_0

Sometimes, one is interested in finer aggregations, for instance by country
and also by occupancy (Residential, Industrial or Commercial); then you have
to set

::

 aggregate_by = ID_0, OCCUPANCY
 reaggregate_by = ID_0

``reaggregate_by` is a new feature of engine 3.13 which allows to go
from a finer aggregation (i.e. one with more tags, in this example 2)
to a coarser aggregation (i.e. one with fewer tags, in this example 1).
Actually the command ``oq reaggregate`` has been there for more than one
year; the new feature is that it is automatically called at the end of
a calculation, by spawning a subcalculation to compute the reaggregation.
Without ``reaggregate_by`` the aggregation by country would be lost,
since only the result of the finer aggregation would be stored.

Single-line commands
--------------------

When using approach #1 your can run all of the required calculations
with the command::

 $ oq engine --run job_Argentina.csv job_Bolivia.csv ...

When using approach #2 your can run all of the required calculations
with the command::

 $ oq engine --run job_rup.ini job_Argentina.csv job_Bolivia.csv ...

When using approach #3 your can run all of the required calculations
with the command::

 $ oq engine --run job_gmf.ini job_Argentina.csv job_Bolivia.csv ...

When using approach #4 your can run all of the required calculations
with the command::

 $ oq engine --run job_all.ini

Here ``job_XXX.ini`` are the country specific configuration files,
``job_rup.ini`` is the file generating the ruptures, ``job_rup.ini``
is the file generating the ruptures, ``job_gmf.ini`` is the file
generating the ground motion files and ``job_all.ini`` is the
file encompassing all countries.

Finally, if you have a file ``job_haz.ini`` generating the full GMFs,
a file ``job_weak.ini`` generating the losses with a weak building code
and a file ``job_strong.ini`` generating the losses with a strong building
code, you can run the entire an analysis with a single command as follows::

 $ oq engine --run job_haz.ini job_weak.ini job_strong.ini

This will generate three calculations and the GMFs will be reused.
This is as efficient as possible for this kind of problem.

Caveat: GMFs are split-dependent
--------------------------------

You should not expect the results of approach #4 to match exactly the
results of approaches #3 or #2, since splitting a calculation by
countries is a tricky operation. In general, if you have a set of
sites and you split it in disjoint subsets, and then you compute the
ground motion fields for each subset, you will get different results
than if you do not split.

To be concrete, if you run a calculation for Chile and then one for
Argentina, you will get different results than running a single
calculation for Chile+Argentina, *even if you have precomputed the
ruptures for both countries, even if the random seeds are the same and
even if there is no spatial correlation*. Many users are surprised but
this fact, but it is obvious if you know how the GMFs are
computed. Suppose you are considering 3 sites in Chile and 2 sites in
Argentina, and that the value of the random seed in 123456: if you
split, assuming there is a single event, you will produce the
following 3+2 normally distributed random numbers:

>>> np.random.default_rng(123456).normal(size=3)  # for Chile
array([ 0.1928212 , -0.06550702,  0.43550665])
>>> np.random.default_rng(123456).normal(size=2)  # for Argentina
array([ 0.1928212 , -0.06550702])

If you do not split, you will generate the following 5 random numbers
instead:

>>> np.random.default_rng(123456).normal(size=5)
array([ 0.1928212 , -0.06550702,  0.43550665,  0.88235875,  0.37132785])

They are unavoidably different. You may argue that not splitting is
the correct way of proceeding, since the splitting causes some
random numbers to be repeated (the numbers 0.1928212 and -0.0655070
in this example) and actually breaks the normal distribution.

In practice, if there is a sufficiently large event-set and if you are
interested in statistical quantities, things work out and you should
see similar results with and without splitting. But you will
*never produce identical results*. Only the classical calculator does
not depend on the splitting of the sites, for event based and scenario
calculations there is no way out.


Special features of the engine
===============================

There are a few less frequently used features of the engine that are not
documented in the general user's manual, since their usage is quite specific. 
They are documented here.

Sensitivity analysis
--------------------------

Running a sensitivity analysis study means to run multiple
calculations by changing a parameter and to study how the results
change. For instance, it is interesting to study the random seed
dependency when running a calculation using sampling of the logic
tree, or it is interesting to study the impact of the truncation level
on the PoEs. The engine offers a special syntax to run a sensitivity
analysis with respect to one (or even more than one) parameter; you
can find examples in the demos, see for instance the
MultiPointClassicalPSHA demo or the EventBasedDamage demo.  It is
enough to write in the job.ini a dictionary of lists like the
following::

 sensitivity_analysis = {"random_seed": [100, 200, 300]}
 sensitivity_analysis = {'truncation_level': [2, 3]}

The first example with run 3 calculations, the second 2 calculations.
The calculations will be sequential unless you specify the ``--many`` flag
in ``oq engine --run --many job.ini``. The descriptions of the spawned
calculation will be extended to include the parameter, so you could
have descriptions as follows::

 Multipoint demo {'truncation_level': 2}
 Multipoint demo {'truncation_level': 3}

NB: from version 3.17 the engine is also able to run sensitivity analysis
on file parameters. For instance if you want to run a ``classical_risk``
calculation starting from three different hazard inputs you can write::

 sensitivity_analysis = {
   "hazard_curves_file": ["hazard1.csv", "hazard2.csv", "hazard3.csv"]}

The ``custom_site_id``
----------------------

Since engine 3.13, it is possible to assign 6-character ASCII strings
as unique identifiers for the sites (8-characters since engine 3.15).
This can be convenient in various
situations, especially when splitting a calculation in geographic regions.
The way to enable it is to add a field called ``custom_site_id`` to
the site model file, which must be unique for each site.

The hazard curve and ground motion field exporters have been modified
to export the ``custom_site_id`` instead of the ``site_id`` (if present).

We used this feature to split the ESHM20 model in two parts (Northern
Europe and Southern Europe). Then creating the full hazard map
was as trivial as joining the generated CSV files. Without the
``custom_site_id`` the site IDs would overlap, thus making impossible to
join the outputs.

A geohash string (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geohash) makes a good
``custom_site_id`` since it can enable the unique identification of all
potential sites across the globe.


The ``minimum_distance`` parameter
----------------------------------

GMPEs often have a prescribed range of validity. In particular they may 
give unexpected results for points too close to ruptures. 
To avoid this problem the engine recognizes a ``minimum_distance`` parameter: 
if it is set, then for distances below the specified minimum distance, 
the GMPEs return the ground-motion value at the minimum distance. 
This avoids producing extremely large (and physically unrealistic) 
ground-motion values at small distances. The minimum distance is somewhat
heuristic. It may be useful to experiment with different values of the
``minimum_distance``, to see how the hazard and risk change.

Equivalent Epicenter Distance Approximation
-------------------------------------------

The equivalent epicenter distance approximation (``reqv`` for short)
was introduced in engine 3.2 to enable the comparison of the OpenQuake
engine with time-honored Fortran codes using the same approximation.

You can enable it in the engine by adding a ``[reqv]`` section to the
job.ini, like in our example in
openquake/qa_tests_data/logictree/case_02/job.ini::

  reqv_hdf5 = {'active shallow crust': 'lookup_asc.hdf5',
               'stable shallow crust': 'lookup_sta.hdf5'}

For each tectonic region type to which the approximation should be applied,
the user must provide a lookup table in .hdf5 format containing arrays
``mags`` of shape M, ``repi`` of shape N and ``reqv`` of shape (M, N).

The examples in openquake/qa_tests_data/classical/case_2 will give you
the exact format required. M is the number of magnitudes (in the examples
there are 26 magnitudes ranging from 6.05 to 8.55) and N is the
number of epicenter distances (in the examples ranging from 1 km to 1000 km).

Depending on the tectonic region type and rupture magnitude, the
engine converts the epicentral distance ``repi`` into an equivalent
distance by looking at the lookup table and use it to determine the
``rjb`` and ``rrup`` distances, instead of the regular routines. This
means that within this approximation ruptures are treated as
pointwise and not rectangular as the engine usually does.

Notice that the equivalent epicenter distance approximation only
applies to ruptures coming from
PointSources/AreaSources/MultiPointSources, fault sources are
untouched.

Ruptures in CSV format
-------------------------------------------

Since engine v3.10 there is a way to serialize ruptures in
CSV format. The command to give is::
  
  $ oq extract "ruptures?min_mag=<mag>" <calc_id>`

For instance, assuming there is an event based calculation with ID 42,
we can extract the ruptures in the datastore with magnitude larger than
6 with ``oq extract "ruptures?min_mag=6" 42``: this will generate a CSV file.
Then it is possible to run scenario
calculations starting from that rupture by simply setting

``rupture_model_file = ruptures-min_mag=6_42.csv``

in the ``job.ini`` file. The format is provisional and may change in the
future, but it will stay a CSV with JSON fields. Here is an example
for a planar rupture, i.e. a rupture generated by a point source::

  #,,,,,,,,,,"trts=['Active Shallow Crust']"
  seed,mag,rake,lon,lat,dep,multiplicity,trt,kind,mesh,extra
  24,5.050000E+00,0.000000E+00,0.08456,0.15503,5.000000E+00,1,Active Shallow Crust,ParametricProbabilisticRupture PlanarSurface,"[[[[0.08456, 0.08456, 0.08456, 0.08456]], [[0.13861, 0.17145, 0.13861, 0.17145]], [[3.17413, 3.17413, 6.82587, 6.82587]]]]","{""occurrence_rate"": 4e-05}"

The format is meant to support all kind of ruptures, including ruptures
generated by simple and complex fault sources, characteristic sources,
nonparametric sources and new kind of sources that could be introduced
in the engine in the future. The header will be the same for all
kind of ruptures that will be stored in the same CSV. Here is description
of the fields as they are named now (engine 3.11):

seed
  the random seed used to compute the GMFs generated by the rupture
mag
  the magnitude of the rupture
rake
  the rake angle of the rupture surface in degrees
lon
  the longitude of the hypocenter in degrees
lat
  the latitude of the hypocenter in degrees
dep
  the depth of the hypocenter in km
multiplicity
  the number of occurrences of the rupture (i.e. number of events)
trt
  the tectonic region type of the rupture; must be consistent with the
  trts listed in the pre-header of the file
kind
  a space-separated string listing the rupture class and the surface class
  used in the engine
mesh
  3 times nested list with lon, lat, dep of the points of the discretized
  rupture geometry for each underlying surface
extra
  extra parameters of the rupture as a JSON dictionary, for instance
  the rupture occurrence rate

Notice that using a CSV file generated with an old version of the engine
is inherently risky: for instance if we changed the
``ParametricProbabilisticRupture`` class or the ``PlanarSurface classes`` in an
incompatible way with the past, then a scenario calculation starting
with the CSV would give different results in the new version of the engine.
We never changed the rupture classes or the surface
classes, but we changed the seed algorithm often, and that too would
cause different numbers to be generated (hopefully, statistically
consistent). A bug fix or change of logic in the calculator can also
change the numbers across engine versions.
  
``max_sites_disagg``
--------------------------------

There is a parameter in the `job.ini` called ``max_sites_disagg``, with a
default value of 10. This parameter controls the maximum number of sites
on which it is possible to run a disaggregation. If you need to run a
disaggregation on a large number of sites you will have to increase
that parameter. Notice that there are technical limits: trying to
disaggregate 100 sites will likely succeed, trying to disaggregate
100,000 sites will most likely cause your system to go out of memory or
out of disk space, and the calculation will be terribly slow.
If you have a really large number of sites to disaggregate, you will
have to split the calculation and it will be challenging to complete
all the subcalculations.

The parameter ``max_sites_disagg`` is extremely important not only for
disaggregation, but also for classical calculations. Depending on its
value and then number of sites (``N``) your calculation can be in the
*few sites* regime or the *many sites regime*.

In the *few sites regime* (``N <= max_sites_disagg``) the engine stores
information for each rupture in the model (in particular the distances
for each site) and therefore uses more disk space. The problem is mitigated
since the engine uses a relatively aggressive strategy to collapse ruptures,
but that requires more RAM available.

In the *many sites regime* (``N > max_sites_disagg``) the engine does not store
rupture information (otherwise it would immediately run out of disk space,
since typical hazard models have tens of millions of ruptures) and uses
a much less aggressive strategy to collapse ruptures, which has the advantage
of requiring less RAM.
