OpenQuake engine is the seismic hazard and risk calculation software developed by the GEM 
Foundation. By following current standards in software developments like test-driven development 
and continuous integration, the OpenQuake engine aims at becoming an open, and community-driven 
tool for seismic hazard and risk analysis.

The source code of the OpenQuake engine is available on a public web-based repository at the 
following address: gem/oq-engine.

General overview
----------------

The OpenQuake Engine software provides calculation and assessment of seismic hazard, risk and 
decision-making tools via the data, methods and standards that are being developed by 
`Global Earthquake Model (GEM) Foundation <https://www.globalquakemodel.org/>`_ 
and its collaborators.

Google Season of Docs funds were used to hire a technical writer to lead the development of
improved documentation.  EFEHR|EPOS and USAID funds (through the FORCE project) were used to 
allocate the time from GEM technical staff.
