Underlying Science
==================

This section aims to provide an explanation of the scientific basis and the 
methodologies adopted in the implementation of the OpenQuake engine, 
an open source code for seismic hazard and physical risk calculation. 
The material follows the traditional openness and transparency features of 
the Global Earthquake Model (GEM) as clearly indicated in the development 
principles of the OpenQuake engine. A particular emphasis is placed on transparency, 
reproducibility, community-based develop- ment and testing (Pagani et al., 2014a), 
the central tenets of the development process adopted since the early stages of the project.

The material presented herein is based on `The OpenQuake engine Book: Hazard`
(Pagani et al., 2014c) and `The OpenQuake engine Book: Risk` (Croweley et al., 2013).
