Glossary of Terms
=================

asset
-----
 
An asset is something of value, which can include buildings and
population. For example, an asset can include an individual building
at a given location, or a number of buildings that are grouped and
co-located at a single location and are classified with the same
*taxonomy*.


branch
------

The simplest element in a logic tree; it belongs to a branch set
where it represents one possible option among a finite number of
alternatives. A branch is associated with a weight value (Scherbaum
and Kuehn, 2011) if the branch set represents the
epistemic uncertainty on a parameter or a model when the branch set
is used to specify alternative models (e.g. district
Magnitude-Frequency Distributions(MFDs)).

branch set
----------

The structure describing the epistemic uncertainty on a specific
parameter or model included in a logic tree structure. It ensembles a
number of branches, each one representing a discrete alternative.

consequence function
--------------------

Consequence functions describe the probability distribution of loss,
given a performance level and are generally derived empirically.

deductible
----------

A parameter used in the calculation of *insured losses* that
establishes the economic value that needs to be deducted from the
*ground-up losses*

earthquake rupture
------------------

A 3D surface - representing a portion or the entire fault surface -
over which a slip event (i.e. an earthquake) occurs.

event loss table
----------------

A list of ruptures from a number of *stochastic event sets* and
respective aggregated losses.

exposure model
--------------

A set of *assets* grouped according to their geographical location,
*taxonomy* and value.

fragility function
------------------

the probability of exceeding a set of limit states, given an
intensity measure level. These functions can be discrete or
continuous.

fragility model
---------------

A set of *fragility functions* used to model the fragility of all the
*assets* in the *exposure model*.

ground-motion field
-------------------

An object describing the geographic distribution around a rupture of
a ground motion intensity measure.

ground-motion prediction equation
---------------------------------

An equation that - given some fundamental parameters characterizing
the source, the propagation path and the site (in the simplest case
magnitude, distance and V\ :sub:`S,30`) - computes the value *GM* of
a (scalar) ground motion intensity parameter.

ground-up losses
----------------

Total direct losses from a collection of assets due to a seismic
event.

insured losses
--------------

Fraction of the *ground-up losses* that can be covered by the insurance
industry, ac- cording to a certain policy which defines *limits* and
*deductibles*.

limit
-----

A parameter used in the calculation of *insured losses* that
establishes the maximum economic amount that can be covered by the
insurance industry, according to a certain insurance policy.

loss disaggregation
-------------------

A methodology to investigate what are the characteristics of the
seismic events that are contributing more significantly to the losses
at a given location, in terms of fundamental variables commonly used
to characterize seismic sources (e.g. magnitude, source-site
distance, location).

seismic source data
-------------------

An object containing the information necessary to completely describe
a PSHA seismic source i.e. seismic source type, position, geometry
and seismicity occurrence model.

seismic source model
--------------------

An object containing a list of seismic source data.

stochastic event set
--------------------

An object containing one or many *seismicity histories*.

taxonomy
--------

Scheme used to classify the *assets*. For buildings, a classification
scheme has been proposed by *GEM* which considers a number of
attributes including lateral load resisting system and its material,
height, year of construction. The taxonomy is currently used to link
the *assets* in the *exposure model* to the relevant *vulnerability
function* or *fragility function*.

vulnerability function
----------------------

A function that describes the probability distribution of loss ratio,
conditioned on an intensity measure level. Currently only discrete
vulnerability functions are supported.

vulnerability model
-------------------

A set of *vulnerability functions* used to model the physical
vulnerability of all the *assets* in the *exposure model*.
