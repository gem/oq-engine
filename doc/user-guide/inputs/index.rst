Input Models
============

The following sections describe the basic inputs required for hazard and risk
calculations, including source or rupture models, ground motion models, logic
trees, site model, exposure models, fragility models, taxonomy mapping,
consequence models, vulnerability models, infrastructure model and
reinsurance models. In addition, each risk calculator also requires the
appropriate hazard inputs computed in the region of interest. Hazard inputs
include hazard curves for the classical probabilistic damage and risk
calculators, Ground Motion Field for the scenario damage and risk
calculators, or Stochastic Event Sets for the probabilistic event based
calculators.
