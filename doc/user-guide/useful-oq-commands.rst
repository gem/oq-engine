Useful OpenQuake Commands
=========================

The oq command-line script is the entry point for several commands, the most important one being *oq engine*, which is 
the recommended way for using the engine thorught the manual.

The commands documented here are consider experimental (some may disappear, others are meant for debugging). 
Still, some of them are quite stable and quite useful for the end-users. Here we document only the commands 
that are useful for the general public and have reached some level of stability.

You can see the full list of commands by running *oq –help*::

	$ oq --help
	usage: oq [-h] [-v]
	          {shell,upgrade_nrml,reduce_smlt,show_attrs,prepare_site_model,nrml_from,shakemap2gmfs,importcalc,run,show,purge,renumber_sm,workers,postzip,plot_assets,db,dbserver,tidy,extract,sample,to_hdf5,ltcsv,reaggregate,restore,mosaic,check_input,dump,info,zip,abort,nrml_to,engine,reset,checksum,export,webui,compare,plot,reduce_sm}
	          ...
	
	positional arguments:
	  {shell,upgrade_nrml,reduce_smlt,show_attrs,prepare_site_model,nrml_from,shakemap2gmfs,importcalc,run,show,purge,renumber_sm,workers,postzip,plot_assets,db,dbserver,tidy,extract,sample,to_hdf5,ltcsv,reaggregate,restore,mosaic,check_input,dump,info,zip,abort,nrml_to,engine,reset,checksum,export,webui,compare,plot,reduce_sm}
	                        available subcommands; use oq <subcmd> --help
	
	options:
	  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
	  -v, --version         show program's version number and exit

This output may change depending on the engine version. There are several commands, like 
*purge, show_attrs, export, restore,* … You can get 
information about each command with *oq <command> –help*; for instance, here is the help for *purge*::

	$ oq purge --help
	usage: oq purge [-h] [-f] calc_id
	
	Remove the given calculation. If you want to remove all calculations, use oq
	reset.
	
	positional arguments:
	  calc_id      calculation ID
	
	optional arguments:
	  -h, --help   show this help message and exit
	  -f, --force  ignore dependent calculations


oq info
-------

Probably the most important command. *oq info* has several features.

3. It can be invoked to provide global information about the engine and its 
   libraries. Try, for instance::

	$ oq info calculators # list available calculators
	$ oq info gsims       # list available GSIMs
	$ oq info views       # list available views
	$ oq info exports     # list available exports
	$ oq info parameters  # list all job.ini parameters

2. It can be invoked with a *job.ini* file to extract information about the logic tree of the calculation.

3. When invoked with the *–report* option, it produces a *.rst* report with important information about the computation. 
   It is ESSENTIAL in the case of large calculations, since it will give you an idea of the feasibility of the computation 
   without running it. Here is an example of usage::

   	$ oq info --report job.ini
	Generated /tmp/report_1644.rst
	<Monitor info, duration=10.910529613494873s, memory=60.16 MB>

   You can open */tmp/report_1644.rst* and read the information listed there (*1644* is the calculation ID, the number will 
   be different each time).

oq export
---------

The second most important command is *oq export*. It allows customization of the exports from the datastore with 
additional flexibility compared to the *oq engine* export commands. In the future the *oq engine* exports commands 
might be deprecated and *oq export* might become the official export command, but we are not there yet.

Here is the usage message::

	$ oq export --help
	usage: oq export [-h] [-e csv] [-d .] datastore_key [calc_id]
	
	Export an output from the datastore.
	
	positional arguments:
	  datastore_key         datastore key
	  calc_id               number of the calculation [default: -1]
	
	optional arguments:
	  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
	  -e csv, --exports csv
	                      export formats (comma separated)
	  -d ., --export-dir .  export directory

The list of available exports (i.e. the datastore keys and the available export formats) can be extracted with the *oq 
info exports* command; the number of exporters defined changes at each version::

	$ oq info exports
	? "aggregate_by" ['csv']
	? "disagg_traditional" ['csv']
	? "loss_curves" ['csv']
	? "losses_by_asset" ['npz']
	Aggregate Asset Losses "agglosses" ['csv']
	Aggregate Loss Curves Statistics "agg_curves-stats" ['csv']
	Aggregate Losses "aggrisk" ['csv']
	Aggregate Risk Curves "aggcurves" ['csv']
	Aggregated Risk By Event "risk_by_event" ['csv']
	Asset Loss Curves "loss_curves-rlzs" ['csv']
	Asset Loss Curves Statistics "loss_curves-stats" ['csv']
	Asset Loss Maps "loss_maps-rlzs" ['csv', 'npz']
	Asset Loss Maps Statistics "loss_maps-stats" ['csv', 'npz']
	Asset Risk Distributions "damages-rlzs" ['npz', 'csv']
	Asset Risk Statistics "damages-stats" ['csv']
	Average Asset Losses "avg_losses-rlzs" ['csv']
	Average Asset Losses Statistics "avg_losses-stats" ['csv']
	Average Ground Motion Field "avg_gmf" ['csv']
	Benefit Cost Ratios "bcr-rlzs" ['csv']
	Benefit Cost Ratios Statistics "bcr-stats" ['csv']
	Disaggregation Outputs "disagg" ['csv']
	Earthquake Ruptures "ruptures" ['csv']
	Events "events" ['csv']
	Exposure + Risk "asset_risk" ['csv']
	Full Report "fullreport" ['rst']
	Ground Motion Fields "gmf_data" ['csv', 'hdf5']
	Hazard Curves "hcurves" ['csv', 'xml', 'npz']
	Hazard Maps "hmaps" ['csv', 'xml', 'npz']
	Input Files "input" ['zip']
	Mean Conditional Spectra "cs-stats" ['csv']
	Realizations "realizations" ['csv']
	Source Loss Table "src_loss_table" ['csv']
	Total Risk "agg_risk" ['csv']
	Uniform Hazard Spectra "uhs" ['csv', 'xml', 'npz']
	There are 44 exporters defined.

At the present the supported export types are *xml*, *csv*, *rst*, *npz* and *hdf5. xml* has been deprecated for some 
outputs and is not the recommended format for large exports. For large exports, the recommended formats are *npz* (which 
is a binary format for numpy arrays) and *hdf5*. If you want the data for a specific realization (say the first one), you 
can use::

	$ oq export hcurves/rlz-0 --exports csv
	$ oq export hmaps/rlz-0 --exports csv
	$ oq export uhs/rlz-0 --exports csv

but currently this only works for *csv* and *xml*. The exporters are one of the most time-consuming parts on the engine, 
mostly because of the sheer number of them; there are more than fifty exporters and they are always increasing. If you 
need new exports, please `add an issue on GitHub <https://github.com/gem/oq-engine/issues>`_.

oq zip
------

An extremely useful command if you need to copy the files associated to a computation from a machine to another is 
*oq zip*::

	$ oq zip --help
	usage: oq zip [-h] [-r] what [archive_zip]
	
	positional arguments:
	  what               path to a job.ini, a ssmLT.xml file, or an exposure.xml
	  archive_zip        path to a non-existing .zip file [default: '']
	
	optional arguments:
	  -h, --help         show this help message and exit
	  -r , --risk-file   optional file for risk

For instance, if you have two configuration files *job_hazard.ini* and *job_risk.ini*, you can zip all the files they 
refer to with the command::

	$ oq zip job_hazard.ini -r job_risk.ini

*oq zip* is actually more powerful than that; other than job.ini files, it can also zip source models::

	$ oq zip ssmLT.xml

and exposures::

	$ oq zip my_exposure.xml

Importing a remote calculation
------------------------------

The use-case is importing on your laptop a calculation that was executed on a remote server/cluster. For that to work 
you need to create a file a file called ``openquake.cfg`` in the virtualenv of the engine (the output of the command 
*oq info venv*, normally it is in $HOME/openquake) with the following section::

	[webapi]
	server = https://oq1.wilson.openquake.org/  # change this
	username = michele  # change this
	password = PWD # change this

Then you can import any calculation by simply giving its ID, as in this example::

	$ oq importcalc 41214
	INFO:root:POST https://oq2.wilson.openquake.org//accounts/ajax_login/
	INFO:root:GET https://oq2.wilson.openquake.org//v1/calc/41214/extract/oqparam
	INFO:root:Saving /home/michele/oqdata/calc_41214.hdf5
	Downloaded 58,118,085 bytes
	{'checksum32': 1949258781,
	 'date': '2021-03-18T15:25:11',
	 'engine_version': '3.12.0-gita399903317'}
	INFO:root:Imported calculation 41214 successfully

oq prepare_site_model
---------------------

The command oq *prepare_site_model*, introduced in engine 3.3, is quite useful if you have a vs30 file with fields lon, 
lat, vs30 and you want to generate a site model from it. Normally this feature is used for risk calculations: given an 
exposure, one wants to generate a collection of hazard sites covering the exposure and with vs30 values extracted from 
the vs30 file with a nearest neighbour algorithm::

	$ oq prepare_site_model -h
	usage: oq prepare_site_model [-h] [-1] [-2] [-3]
	                             [-e [EXPOSURE_XML [EXPOSURE_XML ...]]]
	                             [-s SITES_CSV] [-g 0] [-a 5] [-o site_model.csv]
	                             vs30_csv [vs30_csv ...]
	
	Prepare a site_model.csv file from exposure xml files/site csv files, vs30 csv
	files and a grid spacing which can be 0 (meaning no grid). For each site the
	closest vs30 parameter is used. The command can also generate (on demand) the
	additional fields z1pt0, z2pt5 and vs30measured which may be needed by your
	hazard model, depending on the required GSIMs.
	
	positional arguments:
	  vs30_csv              files with lon,lat,vs30 and no header
	
	optional arguments:
	  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
	  -1, --z1pt0
	  -2, --z2pt5           build the z2pt5
	  -3, --vs30measured    build the vs30measured
	  -e [EXPOSURE_XML [EXPOSURE_XML ...]], --exposure-xml [EXPOSURE_XML [EXPOSURE_XML ...]]
	                        exposure(s) in XML format
	  -s SITES_CSV, --sites-csv SITES_CSV
	  -g 0, --grid-spacing 0
	                        grid spacing in km (the default 0 means no grid)
	  -a 5, --assoc-distance 5
	                        sites over this distance are discarded
	  -o site_model.csv, --output site_model.csv
	                        output file

The command works in two modes: with non-gridded exposures (the default) and with gridded exposures. In the first case 
the unique locations of the assets are identified, and for each location the vs30 coming from the closest vs30 record is taken. 
In the second case, when a *grid_spacing* parameter is passed, a grid containing all of the exposure is built and the 
points with assets are associated to the vs30 records. In both cases if the closest vs30 record is over the 
*site_param_distance* - which by default is 5 km - a warning is printed.

In large risk calculations, it is quite preferable to use the gridded mode because with a well spaced grid,

1. the results are nearly the same than without the grid and
2. the calculation is a lot faster and uses a lot less memory.

Gridding of the exposure makes large calculations more manageable. The command is able to manage multiple Vs30 files at 
once. Here is an example of usage::

	$ oq prepare_site_model Vs30/Ecuador.csv Vs30/Bolivia.csv -e Exposure/Exposure_Res_Ecuador.csv Exposure/Exposure_Res_Bolivia.csv --grid-spacing=10


**Example of a site model using a reduced exposure model**

The image below presents an example for Colombia using the USGS vs30 database and a simplified exposure model with 10.

.. figure:: _images/prepare_site_model.png

   USGS Vs30 data and exposure locations

*Site model with non-gridded exposure (at the asset locations):*
The prepare_site_model command helps users to create a tailored site model file by associating the closest vs30 values at the locations of the exposure model. 

Using the command ::

	$ oq prepare_site_model -e Exposure.xml Vs30_values.csv

the resulting site model file contain the vs30 values closest to the exposure sites. The blue dots represent the generated site model file.

.. figure:: _images/prepare_site_model_opt1.png

*Site model with gridded exposure:*
When dealing with large exposure files (thousands of sites), it is possible to create an uniformly spaced grid. In this case the vs30 values will be the closest to the gridded points. This is possible by passing the flag -g distance_in_km.

Using the command ::

	$ oq prepare_site_model -e Exposure.xml -g 20 Vs30_values.csv

the site model id generated with gridded points close to exposure sites (red dots), and the it considers the closest vs30 values to the gridded points. In this case a 20km grid was used.

.. figure:: _images/prepare_site_model_opt2.png


oq show_attrs 
--------------

The command *oq show_attrs* offers a convenient way to retrieve the attributes of a calculation without needing to open 
the datastore with any external tools::

	$ oq show_attrs -h
	usage: oq show_attrs [-h] key [calc_id]
	
	Show the attributes of a HDF5 dataset in the datastore.
	
	positional arguments:
	  key         key of the datastore
	  calc_id     calculation ID [default: -1]
	
	options:
	  -h, --help  show this help message and exit

If the key / is requested, the root attributes are retrieved. For instance::

	$ oq show_attrs / 4
	
	checksum32 1572793419
	date 2023-04-25T08:19:33
	engine_version 3.17.0-gitcae0748
	input_size 4021

If the calculation id is not specified, the value of the requested key is retrieved for the latest calculation.


Plotting commands
-----------------

The engine provides several plotting commands. They are all experimental and subject to change. They will always be. The 
official way to plot the engine results is by using the QGIS plugin. Still, the *oq* plotting commands are useful for 
debugging purposes. Here I will describe the *plot_assets* command, which allows to plot the exposure used in a 
calculation together with the hazard sites::

	$ oq plot_assets --help
	usage: oq plot_assets [-h] [calc_id]
	
	Plot the sites and the assets
	
	positional arguments:
	  calc_id     a computation id [default: -1]
	
	optional arguments:
	  -h, --help  show this help message and exit

This is particularly interesting when the hazard sites do not coincide with the asset locations, which is normal when 
gridding the exposure.

Very often, it is interesting to plot the sources. While there is a primitive functionality for that in *oq plot*, we 
recommend to convert the sources into .gpkg format and use QGIS to plot them::

	$ oq nrml_to --help
	usage: oq nrml_to [-h] [-o .] [-c] {csv,gpkg} fnames [fnames ...]
	
	Convert source models into CSV files or a geopackage.
	
	positional arguments:
	  {csv,gpkg}        csv or gpkg
	  fnames            source model files in XML
	
	optional arguments:
	  -h, --help        show this help message and exit
	  -o ., --outdir .  output directory
	  -c, --chatty      display sources in progress

For instance `$ oq nrml_to gpkg source_model.xml -o source_model.gpkg` will convert the sources in .gpkg format while
`$ oq nrml_to csv source_model.xml -o source_model.csv` will convert the sources in .csv format. Both are fully supported 
by QGIS. The CSV format has the advantage of being transparent and easily editable; it also can be imported in a 
geospatial database like Postgres, if needed.

.. _prepare-site-model:


Reducing the source model
-------------------------

Source models are usually large, at the continental scale. If you are interested in a city or in a small region, it 
makes sense to reduce the model to only the sources that would affect the region, within the integration distance. To 
fulfil this purpose there is the *oq reduce_sm* command. The suggestion is run a preclassical calculation (i.e. set 
*calculation_mode=preclassical* in the job.ini) with the full model in the region of interest, keep track of the 
calculation ID and then run::

	$ oq reduce_sm <calc_id>

The command will reduce the source model files and add an extension *.bak* to the original ones.::

	$ oq reduce_sm -h
	usage: oq reduce_sm [-h] calc_id
	
	Reduce the source model of the given (pre)calculation by discarding all
	sources that do not contribute to the hazard.
	
	positional arguments:
	  calc_id     calculation ID
	
	optional arguments:
	  -h, --help  show this help message and exit

Comparing hazard results
------------------------

If you are interested in sensitivity analysis, i.e. in how much the results of the engine change by tuning a parameter, 
the *oq compare* command is useful. It is able to compare many things, depending on the engine version. Here are a few 
examples::

	$ oq compare hcurves --help
	usage: oq compare hcurves [-h] [-f] [-s] [-r 0] [-a 0.001] imt calc_ids [calc_ids ...]
	
	Compare the hazard curves of two or more calculations.
	
	positional arguments:
	  imt                   intensity measure type to compare
	  calc_ids              calculation IDs
	
	optional arguments:
	  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
	  -f, --files           write the results in multiple files
	  -s , --samplesites    sites to sample (or fname with site IDs)
	  -r 0, --rtol 0        relative tolerance
	  -a 0.001, --atol 0.001
	                        absolute tolerance
	
	$ oq compare hmaps --help
	usage: oq compare hmaps [-h] [-f] [-s] [-r 0] [-a 0.001] imt calc_ids [calc_ids ...]
	
	Compare the hazard maps of two or more calculations.
	
	positional arguments:
	  imt                   intensity measure type to compare
	  calc_ids              calculation IDs
	
	optional arguments:
	  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
	  -f, --files           write the results in multiple files
	  -s , --samplesites    sites to sample (or fname with site IDs)
	  -r 0, --rtol 0        relative tolerance
	  -a 0.001, --atol 0.001
	                        absolute tolerance
	
	$ oq compare uhs --help
	usage: oq compare uhs [-h] [-f] [-s] [-r 0] [-a 0.001] calc_ids [calc_ids ...]
	
	Compare the uniform hazard spectra of two or more calculations.
	
	positional arguments:
	  calc_ids              calculation IDs
	
	optional arguments:
	  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
	  -f, --files           write the results in multiple files
	  -s , --samplesites    sites to sample (or fname with site IDs)
	  -r 0, --rtol 0        relative tolerance
	  -a 0.001, --atol 0.001
	                        absolute tolerance

Notice the ``compare uhs`` is able to compare all IMTs at once, so it is the most convenient to use if there are many IMTs.


Mosaic-related commands
-----------------------

Mosaic-related commands are defined as subcommands of the oq mosaic command::

	$ oq mosaic -h
	usage: oq mosaic [-h] {run_site,sample_rups,sample_gmfs} ...
	
	positional arguments:
	  {run_site,sample_rups,sample_gmfs}
	                        available subcommands; use oq mosaic <subcmd> --help
	
	options:
	  -h, --help            show this help message and exit

***********************
Running a PSHA analysis
***********************

The *oq mosaic run_site* subcommand gives the possibility to run a PSHA analysis for a site on the given longitude and 
latitude, or for multiple sites specified in a CSV file::

	$ oq mosaic run_site -h
	usage: oq mosaic run_site [-h] [--hc HC] [-s SLOWEST] [-c 8] lonlat_or_fname
	
	Run a PSHA analysis on the given lon, lat
	
	positional arguments:
	  lonlat_or_fname       lon,lat of the site to analyze or CSV file
	
	options:
	  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
	  --hc HC               previous calculation ID
	  -s SLOWEST, --slowest SLOWEST
	                        profile and show the slowest operations
	  -c 8, --concurrent-jobs 8
	                        maximum number of concurrent jobs

If a CSV file is provided, it must contain in each row a site identifier starting with the 3-character code of the 
mosaic model that covers it, and the longitude and latitude of the site, separated by commas.

*****************
Sampling ruptures
*****************

The *oq mosaic sample_rups* subcommand gives the possibility to sample the ruptures of the given model in the mosaic 
with an effective investigation time of 100,000 years::

	$ oq mosaic sample_rups -h
	usage: oq mosaic sample_rups [-h] [-s SLOWEST] model
	
	Sample the ruptures of the given model in the mosaic with an effective investigation time of 100,000 years
	
	positional arguments:
	  model                 3-letter name of the model
	
	options:
	  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
	  -s SLOWEST, --slowest SLOWEST
	                        profile and show the slowest operations

*****************************
Sampling ground motion fields
*****************************

The *oq mosaic sample_gmfs* subcommand gives the possiblity to sample the gmfs of the given model in the mosaic with an 
effective investigation time of 100,000 years::

	positional arguments:
	  model                 3-letter name of the model
	
	options:
	  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
	  -t -1, --trunclevel -1
	                        truncation level (default: the one in job_vs30.ini)
	  -m 0.0, --mindist 0.0
	                        minimum_distance (default: 0)
