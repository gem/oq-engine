Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)
================================

FAQ for IT issues
-----------------

******************************************************************
Help! What is the recommended hardware to run engine calculations?
******************************************************************

It depends on your use case and your level of expertise. Most of our users are scientists with little IT experience 
and/or little support from their IT departments. For them we recommend to buy a very powerful server and not a cluster, 
which is complex to manage. A server with 256 GB of RAM and 64 real cores is currently powerful enough to run all of the 
calculations in the GEM global hazard and risk mosaic. If you have larger calculations and IT expertise, for a cluster 
setup see the :ref:`hardware suggestions <hardware-requirements>` and :ref:`cluster <cluster>` pages.

****************************************************
Help! I have a multi-node cluster and I'm in trouble
****************************************************

If you are running the OpenQuake engine on a multi-node cluster you should also have a look at :ref:`FAQ related to cluster 
deployments <faq-cluster>`.

**************************************
Help! Should I disable hyperthreading?
**************************************

Disabling hyperthreading is recommended since it will save memory. Suppose for instance that you have a laptop with a 
powerful i9 processor and 16 GB of RAM. It seems a lot. In reality it is not. The operating system will consume some 
memory, the browser will consume a lot of memory, you may have other applications open and you may end up with less than 
10 GB of available memory. If hyperthreading is enabled the engine will see 10x2 = 20 cores; running parallel computations 
may easily consume 0.5 GB per core, i.e. 10 GB, so you will run out of memory. With hyperthreading disabled you will still 
have 5 GB of available RAM.

**Note**: on a linux machine you can try disable hyperthreading temporarily with the command ``sudo echo off > 
/sys/devices/system/cpu/smt/control``: however, this setting will not survive a reboot. Also, on some systems this 
command will not work. If you cannot disable hyperthreading just make sure that if you have enough memory: we 
recommend at least 2 GB per thread.

*******************************************************
Help! My windows server with 32/64 or more cores hangs!
*******************************************************

Some users reported this issue. It is due to a limitation of Python multiprocessing module on Windows. In all cases we 
have seen, the problem was solved by disabling hyperthreading. Otherwise you can reduce the number of used cores by 
setting the parameter ``num_cores`` in the file openquake.cfg as explained below.

************************************************************
Help! I want to limit the number of cores used by the engine
************************************************************

This is another way to save memory. If you are on a single machine, the way to do it is to edit the file openquake.cfg 
and add the lines (if for instance you want to use 8 cores)::

	[distribution]
	num_cores = 8

If you are on a cluster you must edit the section [zworkers] and the parameter ``host_cores``, replacing the ``-1`` with 
the number of cores to be used on each machine.

*********************************
Help! I am running out of memory!
*********************************

If you are on a laptop, the first thing to do is close all memory consuming applications. Remember that running the 
engine from the command-line is the most memory-efficient way to run calculations (browesers can use significant memory 
from your laptop). You can also limit the number of parallel threads as explained before (i.e. disable hyperthreading, 
reduce num_cores) or disable parallelism altogether. If you still run out of memory, then you must reduce your 
calculation or upgrade your system.

*****************************************************************************************************************
Help! Is it possible to configure multiple installations of the engine to run independently on the same computer?
*****************************************************************************************************************

Yes, it is possible, as long as their virtual environments are stored in different directories and the ports used by 
their dbservers are different.

When you install the engine using the ``install.py`` script, you may specify the ``--venv`` parameter to choose in which 
directory the engine virtual environment must be stored. On an existing installation of the engine, you can run the 
command::

	$ oq info venv

to retrieve the path of its virtual environment.

Another parameter accepted by the ``install.py`` script is ``--dbport``, that specifies the port number used by the 
engine dbserver. By default, the port is set to 1907 for server installations or 1908 for user installations. The port 
can be customized through the attribute ``port`` of section ``[dbserver]`` in the configuration file ``openquake.cfg``, 
placed inside the virtual environment directory, e.g.::

	[dbserver]
	    port = 1907

########################################################################
Can two installations of the engine share the same ``oqdata`` directory?
########################################################################

The ``oqdata`` directory, that stores calculation data, can safely be shared between two different instances of the 
engine working on a same computer. Each HDF5 dataset is independent from all others in the datastore and it has a unique 
identifier. It is possible to determine the version of the engine that produced each HDF5 file (``calc_<calc_id>.hdf5``) 
using the command::

	$ oq show_attrs / <calc_id>

where ``/`` indicates the root attributes (date, engine_version, etc.) and ``<calc_id>`` (an integer number) is the 
calculation identifier. In case the calculation id is not specified, the attributes are retrieved for the latest 
calculation.

******************************
Different installation methods
******************************

The OpenQuake engine has several installation methods. To choose the one that best fits your needs take a look at the 
:ref:`installation overview <installing-the-openquake-engine>`.

###########################
Supported operating systems
###########################

Binary packages are `provided for Windows <https://downloads.openquake.org/pkgs/windows/oq-engine>`__.  For all other 
systems use the :ref:`universal installer <universal>`. We also provide :ref:`Docker containers <docker>`.

Binary packages are provided for the following 64bit operating systems::

- Windows 10
- macOS 11.6+
- Linux Ubuntu 18.04+ and RedHat/CentOS 7/RockyLinux 8 via deb and rpm
- Any other generic Linux distribution via the universal installer
- Docker hosts

A 64bit operating system **is required**. Please refer to each OS specific page for details about requirements.

.. _unsupported-operating-systems:

#############################
Unsupported operating systems
#############################

- Windows 8 may or may not work and we will not provide support for it Binary packages *may* work on Ubuntu derivatives and Debian if the dependencies are satisfied; these configurations are known to work:
- Ubuntu 18.04 (Bionic) packages work on **Debian 10.0** (Buster)
- Ubuntu 20.04 (Focal) packages work on **Debian 11.0** (Bullseye)

These configurations however are not tested and we cannot guarantee on the quality of the results. Use at your own risk.

#############
32bit support
#############

The OpenQuake engine **requires a 64bit operating system**. Starting with version v2.3 of the Engine binary installers 
and packages aren't provided for 32bit operating systems anymore.

.. _mpi-support:

###########
MPI support
###########

MPI is not supported by the OpenQuake engine. Task distribution across network interconnected nodes is done via *zmq*. 
The worker nodes must have read access to a shared file system writeable from the master node. Data transfer is made on 
TCP/IP connection.

MPI support may be added in the future if sponsored by someone. If you would like to help support development of 
OpenQuake engine, please contact us at partnership@globalquakemodel.org.

-------

########################
Python 2.7 compatibility
########################

Support for Python 2.7 has been dropped. The last version of the Engine compatible with Python 2.7 is 
OpenQuake engine version 2.9 (Jeffreys).

####################################
Python scripts that import openquake
####################################

On **Ubuntu** and **RHEL** if a third party python script (or a Jupyter notebook) needs to import openquake as a library 
(as an example: ``from openquake.commonlib import readinput``) you must use a virtual environment and install a local 
copy of the Engine::

	$ python3 -m venv </path/to/myvenv>
	$ . /path/to/myvenv/bin/activate
	$ pip3 install openquake.engine

##############################################
Errors upgrading from an old version on Ubuntu
##############################################

When upgrading from an OpenQuake engine version **older than 2.9 to a newer one** you may encounter an error on Ubuntu. Using 
``apt`` to perform the upgrade you may get an error like this::

	Unpacking oq-python3.5 (3.5.3-1ubuntu0~gem03~xenial01) ...
	dpkg: error processing archive /var/cache/apt/archives/oq-python3.5_3.5.3-1ubuntu0~gem03~xenial01_amd64.deb (--unpack):
	 trying to overwrite '/opt/openquake/bin/easy_install', which is also in package python-oq-libs 1.3.0~dev1496296871+a6bdffb

This issue can be resolved uninstalling OpenQuake engine first and then making a fresh installation of the latest version::

	$ sudo apt remove python-oq-.*
	$ sudo rm -Rf /opt/openquake
	$ sudo apt install python3-oq-engine

##########################
OpenQuake Hazardlib errors
##########################

::

	pkg_resources.DistributionNotFound: The 'openquake.hazardlib==0.XY' distribution was not found and is required by openquake.engine

Since OpenQuake engine 2.5, the OpenQuake Hazardlib package has been merged with the OpenQuake engine one.

If you are using git and you have the ``PYTHONPATH`` set you should update ``oq-engine`` and then remove ``oq-hazardlib`` 
from your filesystem and from the ``PYTHONPATH``, to avoid any possible confusion.

If ``oq-hazardlib`` has been installed via ``pip`` you must uninstall both ``openquake.engine`` and ``openquake.hazardlib`` 
first, and then reinstall ``openquake.engine``.::

	$ pip uninstall openquake.hazardlib openquake.engine
	$ pip install openquake.engine
	# -OR- development installation
	$ pip install -e /path/to/oq-engine/

If you are using Ubuntu or RedHat packages no extra operations are needed, the package manager will remove the old 
``python-oq-hazardlib`` package and replace it with a fresh copy of ``python3-oq-engine``.

On Ubuntu make sure to run ``apt dist-upgrade`` instead on ``apt upgrade`` to make a proper upgrade of the OpenQuake 
packages.

##########################################################
'The openquake master lost its controlling terminal' error
##########################################################

When the OpenQuake engine is driven via the ``oq`` command over an SSH connection an associated terminal must exist 
throughout the ``oq`` calculation lifecycle. The ``openquake.engine.engine.MasterKilled: The openquake master lost its 
controlling terminal`` error usually means that the SSH connection has dropped or the controlling terminal has been 
closed having a running computation attached to it.

To avoid this error please use ``nohup``, ``screen``, ``tmux`` or ``byobu`` when using ``oq`` via SSH. More information 
is available on :ref:`Running the OpenQuake engine <unix>`.

##############
DbServer ports
##############

The default port for the DbServer (configured via the ``openquake.cfg`` configuration file) is ``1908`` (for a 
development installation) or ``1907`` (for a package installation).

###############
Swap partitions
###############

Having a swap partition active on resources fully dedicated to the OpenQuake engine is discouraged. More info 
:ref:`here <cluster>`.

################################
System running out of disk space
################################

The OpenQuake engine may require lot of disk space for the raw results data (``hdf5`` files stored in ``/home/<user>/oqdata``) 
and the temporary files used to either generated outputs or load input files via the ``API``. On certain cloud 
configurations the amount of space allocated to the root fs (``/``) is fairly limited and extra 'data' volumes needs to 
be attached. To make the Engine use these volumes for ``oqdata`` and the temporary storage you must change the 
``openquake.cfg`` configuration; assuming ``/mnt/ext_volume`` as the mount point of the extra 'data' volume, it must be 
changed as follow:

- ``shared_dir`` must be set to ``/mnt/ext_volume``
- A ``tmp`` dir must be created in ``/mnt/ext_volume``
- ``custom_tmp`` must be set to ``/mnt/ext_volume/tmp`` (the directory must exist)

FAQ about running hazard calculations
-------------------------------------

*************************************************************************
Can I estimate the runtime of a classical calculation without running it?
*************************************************************************

Since engine v3.15 you can. The trick is to run a reduced calculation first, by using the command::

	$ oq engine --run job.ini --sample-sources=0.01

This will reduce the number of ruptures by ~100 times so that the reduced calculation will complete in a reasonable 
amount of time. Then in the log you will see the estimate runtime for the full calculation. For instance for the SHARE 
model on a computer with an i7 processor you will see something like this::

	[2022-04-19 08:57:05 #4054 INFO] Estimated time 72.3 hours

The estimate is rather rough, so do not take it at the letter. The runtime can be reduced by orders of magnitude by 
tuning parameters like the ``pointsource_distance`` and ``ps_grid_spacing``, discussed at length in the advanced manual.

*************************************************
How should I interpret the "Realizations" output?
*************************************************

This is explained in the :ref:`logic trees section <logic-trees>`

****************************************************************
How do I export the hazard curves/maps/uhs for each realization?
****************************************************************

By default the engine only exports statistical results, i.e. the mean hazard curves/maps/uhs. If you want the individual 
results you must set ``individual_rlzs=true`` in the job.ini files. Please take care: if you have thousands of realizations 
(which is quite common) the data transfer and disk space requirements will be thousands of times larger than just 
returning the mean results: the calculation might fail. This is why by default ``individual_rlzs`` is false.

*************************************************************************
Argh, I forgot to set ``individual_rlzs``! Must I repeat the calculation?
*************************************************************************

No, just set ``individual_rlzs=true`` in the job.ini and run::

	$ oq engine --run job.ini --hc=<ID> --exports csv

where ``<ID>`` must be replaced with the ID of the original calculation. The individual outputs will be regenerated by 
reusing the result of the previous calculation: it will be a lot faster than repeating the calculation from scratch.

*************************************************************************
Argh, I set the wrong poes in the job.ini? Must I repeat the calculation?
*************************************************************************

No, set the right poes in the job.ini and as before run::

	$ oq engine --run job.ini --hc=<ID> --exports csv

where ``<ID>`` must be replaced with the ID of the original calculation. Hazard maps and UHS can be regenerated from an 
existing calculation quite efficiently.

***********************************************************
I am getting an error "disaggregation matrix is too large"!
***********************************************************

This means that you have too many disaggregation bins. Please act on the binning parameters, i.e. on ``mag_bin_width``, 
``distance_bin_width``, ``coordinate_bin_width``, ``num_epsilon_bins``. The most relevant parameter is ``coordinate_bin_width`` 
which is quadratic: for instance by changing from ``coordinate_bin_width=0.1`` to ``coordinate_bin_width=1.0`` the size of 
your disaggregation matrix will be reduced by 100 times.

************************************************************************
What is the relation between sources, ruptures, events and realizations?
************************************************************************

A single rupture can produce multiple seismic events during the investigation time. How many depends on the number of 
stochastic event sets, on the rupture occurrence rate and on the ``ses_seed`` parameters, as explained 
:ref:`here <rupture-sampling-how-does-it-work>`. In the 
engine a rupture is uniquely identified by a rupture ID, which is a 32 bit positive integer. Starting from engine v3.7, 
seismic events are uniquely identified by an event ID, which is a 32 bit positive integer. The relation between event ID 
and rupture ID is given encoded in the ``events`` table in the datastore, which also contains the realization associated 
to the event. The properties of the rupture generating the events can be ascertained by looking inside the ``ruptures`` 
table. In particular ther ``srcidx`` contains the index of the source that generated the rupture. The ``srcidx`` can be 
used to extract the properties of the sources by looking inside the ``source_info`` table, which contains the ``source_id`` 
string used in the XML source model.

************************************************
Can I run a calculation from a Jupyter notebook?
************************************************

You can run any kind of calculation from a Jupyter notebook, but usually calculations are long and it is not convenient 
to run them interactively. Scenarios are an exception, since they are usually fast, unless you use spatial correlation 
with a lot of sites. Assuming the parameters of the calculation are in a ``job.ini`` file you can run the following lines 
in the notebook::

	In[1]: from openquake.calculators.base import run_calc
	In[2]: calc = run_calc('job.ini')

Then you can inspect the contents of the datastore and perform your postprocessing::

	In[3]: calc.datastore.open('r')  # open the datastore for reading

The inner format of the datastore is not guaranteed to be the same across releases and it is not documented, so this 
approach is recommended to the most adventurous people.

***************************************************************
how do I plot/analyze/postprocess the results of a calculation?
***************************************************************

The official way to plot the result of a calculation is to use the `QGIS plugin <https://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/svir/>`_. 
However you may want a kind of plot which is not available in the plugin, or you may want to batch-produce hundreds of 
plots, or you may want to plot the results of a postprocessing operation. In such cases you need to use the 
extract API and to write your own plotting/postprocessing code.

.. _faq-risk:

FAQ about running risk calculations
-----------------------------------

***********************************************************************************************
What implications do ``random_seed``, ``ses_seed``, and ``master_seed`` have on my calculation?
***********************************************************************************************

The OpenQuake engine uses (Monte Carlo) sampling strategies for propagating epistemic uncertainty at various stages in a 
calculation. The sampling is based on numpy's pseudo-random number generator. Setting a 'seed' is useful for controlling 
the initialization of the random number generator, and repeating a calculation using the same seed should result in 
identical random numbers being generated each time.

Three different seeds are currently recognized and used by the OpenQuake engine.

- ``random_seed`` is the seed that controls the sampling of branches from both the source model logic tree and the ground motion model logic tree, when the parameter ``number_of_logic_tree_samples`` is non-zero. It affects both classical calculations and event based calculations.
- ``ses_seed`` is the seed that controls the sampling of the ruptures in an event based calculation (but notice that the generation of ruptures is also affected by the ``random_seed``, unless full enumeration of the logic tree is used, due to the reasons mentioned in the previous paragraph). It is also used to generate rupture seeds for both event based and scenario calculations, which are in turn used for sampling ground motion values / intensities from a Ground Motion Model, when the parameter ``truncation_level`` is non-zero. NB: before engine v3.11, sampling ground motion values / intensities from a GMM in a scenario calculation was incorrectly controlled by the ``random_seed`` and not the ``ses_seed``.
- ``master_seed`` is used when generating the epsilons in a calculation involving vulnerability functions with non-zero coefficients of variations. This is a purely risk-related seed, while the previous two are hazard-related seeds.

***************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
What values should I use for ``investigation_time``, ``ses_per_logic_tree_path``, and ``number_of_logic_tree_samples`` in my calculation? And what does the ``risk_investigation_time`` parameter for risk calculations do?
***************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************

Setting the ``number_of_logic_tree_samples`` is relatively straightforward. This parameter controls the method used for 
propagation of epistemic uncertainty represented in the logic-tree structure and calculation of statistics such as the 
mean, median, and quantiles of key results.

``number_of_logic_tree_samples = 0`` implies that the engine will perform a so-called 'full-enumeration' of the 
logic-tree, i.e., it will compute the requested results for every end-branch, or 'path' in the logic-tree. Statistics 
are then computed with consideration of the relative weights assigned to each end-branch.

For models that have complex logic-trees containing thousands, or even millions of end-branches, a full-enumeration 
calculation will be computationally infeasible. In such cases, a sampling strategy might be more preferable and much 
more tractable. Setting, for instance, ``number_of_logic_tree_samples = 100`` implies that the engine will randomly 
choose (i.e., 'sample') 100 end-branches from the complete logic-tree based on the weight assignments. The requested 
results will be computed for each of these 100 sampled end-branches. Statistics are then computed using the results from 
the 100 sampled end-branches, where the 100 sampled end-branches are considered to be equi-weighted (1/100 weight for each 
sampled end-branch). Note that once the end-branches have been chosen for the calculation, the initial weights assigned 
in the logic-tree files have no further role to play in the computation of the statistics of the requested results. As 
mentioned in the previous section, changing the ``random_seed`` will result in a different set of paths or end-branches 
being sampled.

The ``risk_investigation_time`` parameter is also fairly straightforward. It affects only the risk part of the computation 
and does not affect the hazard calculations or results. Two of the most common risk metrics are (1) the time-averaged risk 
value (damages, losses, fatalities) for a specified time-window, and (2) the risk values (damages, losses, fatalities) 
corresponding to a set of return periods. The ``risk_investigation_time`` parameter controls the time-window used for 
computing the former category of risk metrics. Specifically, setting ``risk_investigation_time = 1`` will produce average 
annual risk values; such as average annual collapses, average annual losses, and average annual fatalities. This parameter 
does not affect the computation of the latter category of risk metrics. For example, the loss exceedance curves will 
remain the same irrespective of the value set for ``risk_investigation_time``, provided all other parameters are kept the 
same.

Next, we come to the two parameters ``investigation_time`` and ``ses_per_logic_tree_path``.

If the hazard model includes time-dependent sources, the choice of the ``investigation_time`` will most likely be dictated 
by the source model(s), and the engine will raise an error unless you set the value to that required by the source 
model(s). In this case, the ``ses_per_logic_tree_path`` parameter can be used to control the effective length of the 
stochastic event-set (or event catalog) for each end-branch, or 'path', for both full-enumeration and sampling-based 
calculations. As an example, suppose that the hazard model requires you to set ``investigation_time = 1``, because the 
source model defines 1-year occurrence probabilities for the seismic sources. Further, suppose you have decided to sample 
100 branches from the complete logic-tree as your strategy to propagate epistemic uncertainty. Now, setting 
``ses_per_logic_tree_path = 10000`` will imply that the engine will generate 10,000 'event-sets' for each of the 100 
sampled branches, where each 'event-set' spans 1 year. Note that some of these 1-year event-sets could be empty, implying 
that no events were generated in those particular 1-year intervals.

On the other hand, if the hazard model contains only time-independent sources, there is no hard constraint on the 
``investigation_time`` parameter. In this case, the ``ses_per_logic_tree_path`` parameter can be used in conjunction with 
the ``investigation_time`` to control the effective length of the stochastic event-set (or event catalog) for each 
end-branch, or 'path', for both full-enumeration and sampling-based calculations. For instance, the following three 
calculation settings would produce statistically equivalent risk results:

**Calculation 1**

::

	number_of_logic_tree_samples = 0
	investigation_time = 1
	ses_per_logic_tree_path = 10000
	risk_investigation_time = 1

**Calculation 2**

::

	number_of_logic_tree_samples = 0
	investigation_time = 50
	ses_per_logic_tree_path = 200
	risk_investigation_time = 1

**Calculation 3**

::

	number_of_logic_tree_samples = 0
	investigation_time = 10000
	ses_per_logic_tree_path = 1
	risk_investigation_time = 1

The effective catalog length per branch in such cases is ``investigation_time × ses_per_logic_tree_path``. The choice of 
how to split the effective catalog length amongst the two parameters is up to the modeller/analyst's preferrence, and 
there are no performance implications for perferring particular choices.

Note that if you were also computing hazard curves and maps in the above example calculations, the hazard curves output 
in the first calculation would provide probabilities of exceedance in 1 year, whereas the hazard curves output in the 
second calculation would provide probabilities of exceedance in 50 years. All **risk** results for the three calculations 
will be statistically identical.

Starting from engine v3.10 you can get a summary of the total losses across your portfolio of assets arising from each 
seismic source, over the effective investigation time. For instance run the event based risk demo as follows::

	$ oq engine --run job.ini

and export the output "Source Loss Table". You should see a table like the one below:

+------------+---------------+----------------+
| **source** | **loss_type** | **loss_value** |
+============+===============+================+
|    231     | nonstructural |  1.07658E+10   |
+------------+---------------+----------------+
|    231     |  structural   |  1.63773E+10   |
+------------+---------------+----------------+
|    386     | nonstructural |  3.82246E+07   |

from which one can infer the sources causing the highest total losses for the portfolio of assets within the specified 
effective investigation time.

*************************************************************************
How does the engine compute loss curves (a.k.a. Probable Maximum Losses)?
*************************************************************************

The PML for a given return period is built from the losses in the event loss table. The algorithm used is documented in 
detail in the advanced manual at the end of the section about risk calculations. The section also explains why sometimes 
the PML or the loss curves contain NaN values (the effective investigation time is too short compared to the return 
period). Finally, it also explains why the PML is not additive.

What it is the proper way to install the engine on a supercomputer cluster?
***************************************************************************

Normally a supercomputer cluster cannot be fully assigned to the OpenQuake engine, so you cannot perform the :ref:`regular 
cluster installation <cluster>`. We suggest to do the following instead:

- install the engine in server mode on the machine that will host the database and set ``shared_dir=/opt/openquake`` in the openquake.cfg file; such machine can have low specs; optionally, you can run the WebUI there, so that the users can easily download the results
- expose /opt/openquake to all the machines in the cluster by using a read-write shared filesystem
- then run the calculations on the other cluster nodes; the outputs will be saved in /opt/openquake/oqdata and the code will be read from /opt/openquake/venv; this will work if all the nodes have a vanilla python installation consistent with the one on the database machine.

*********************************************
Recover after a Out Of Memory (OOM) condition
*********************************************

When an Out Of Memory (OOM) condition occours on the master node the ``oq`` process is terminated by the operating system 
OOM killer via a ``SIGKILL`` signal.

Due to the forcefully termination of ``oq``, processes may be left running, using resources (both CPU and RAM), until 
the task execution reaches an end.

To free up resources for a new run **you must kill all openquake processes on the workers nodes**; this will stop any 
other running computation which is anyway highly probable to be already broken due to the OOM condition on the master 
node.

This happens when the :ref:`shared dir <cluster>` 
is not configured properly and workers cannot access data from the master node. Please note that starting with OpenQuake 
engine 3.3 the shared directory is required on multi-node deployments.

You can get more information about setting up the shared directory on the :ref:`cluster installation page <cluster>`.
