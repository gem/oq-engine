Glossary of Terms
=================

Area Source
-----------

A source type usually adopted to model distributed seismicity. In an area source the seismicity occurrence rate is 
assumed uniform over the source area; this produces an hazard pattern with aplateau of constant hazard inside the 
polygon delimiting the area sourceand values of hazard that tend to decrease as we move away from the border of the 
source

Asset
-----

An asset is an element with a certain value, which can include buildings or population. For example, an asset can include 
an individual building at a given location, or a number of buildings that are grouped, co- located at a single location 
and classified with the same *Taxonomy*

Branch
------

The simplest element in a logic tree; it belongs to a *Branch Set* where it represents one possible option among a finite 
number of alternatives. A branch is associated with a weight value if the *Branch Set* represents the epistemic uncertainty 
on a parameter or a model when the *Branch Set* is used to specify alternative models (e.g. district 
*Magnitude-Frequency Distribution*)

Branch Set
----------

The structure describing the epistemic uncertainty on a specific parameter or model included in a logic tree structure. 
It ensembles a number of *Branch*, each one representing a discrete alternative

Calculation
-----------

A unique set of input files for which we attempt to produce results. Input files include an INI-style config file 
(containing various calculation parameters) and various XML files. The structure of these XML files is defined by our 
XML specification: NRML. The quantity, type, and content of these XML files will vary depending on the calculation mode.

The terms calculation and job are often used synonymously, but it is important to understand the distinction.

Calculator
----------

A Python class which can implement various methods associated with each calculation phase. In order of execution, the 
phases are:

- pre_execute
- execute (this is the only required method)
- post_execute
- post_process
- export
- clean_up

Each calculation mode has its own calculator class defined, although many common functionalities are shared between 
calculators. This common functionality is abstracted into common base classes and plain functions.

-----------------

Control Node
------------

The machine from which the user initiates a calculation. The control is responsible for running code which processes user 
input, initializes a calculation, distributes work, and manages/monitors the calculation until completion.

By convention, the machine used as the control node does not process tasks. The control node is also typically the 
machine which runs vital server processes, such as RabbitMQ, and PostgreSQL/PostGIS.
