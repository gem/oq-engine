==========

This user guide is intended to provide a comprehensive overview of the
OpenQuake engine, its capabilities and how to use it. It is divided into
several sections, each of which is intended to provide a detailed description
of a specific aspect of the engine. 

**Section 1.** :ref:`workflows`: describes the various calculation workflows 
that are currently supported by the OpenQuake engine. 

**Section 2.** :ref:`input-models`: describes the input models that are required
to run various OpenQuake engine calculations and their file formats. 

**Section 3.** :ref:`configuration-file`: describes the configuration file
that is used to specify the calculation settings and we provide the list of
available calculation parameters for each calculation workflow.

**Section 4.** :ref:`outputs`: describes the output files that are
generated by the OpenQuake engine following successful calculations 
and their file formats.

**Section 5.** :ref:`advanced-features`: intended as a guide for advanced users who 
wish to run calculations that are more complex and require more detailed knowledge of 
the OpenQuake engine. Includes special features, useful commands and examples to work
with the dstore.

**Section 6.** :ref:`extras`: contains additional information, including 
frequently asked questions, common mistakes, bad choices for some
