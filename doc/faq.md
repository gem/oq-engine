# FAQ

### Python 2.7 compatibility 

Support for Python 2.7 has been dropped. The last version of the Engine compatible with Python 2.7 is **[OpenQuake Engine version 2.9 (Jeffreys)](https://github.com/gem/oq-engine/tree/engine-2.9#openquake-engine)**.

******

### Different installation methods

The OpenQuake Engine has at least three installation methods. To choose the one that best fits your needs take a look at the **[installation overview](installing/overview.md)**.

******

### Supported operating systems

Binary packages are provided for the following 64bit operating systems:
- [Windows](installing/windows.md)
- [macOS](installing/macos.md)
- Linux [Ubuntu](installing/ubuntu.md) and [RedHat/CentOS/Scientific Linux/Fedora](installing/rhel.md) via _deb_ and _rpm_
- Any other generic Linux distribution via a [self-installable binary distribution](installing/linux-generic.md)
- [Docker](installing/docker.md) hosts

A 64bit operating system **is required**. Please refer to each OS specific page for details about requirements.

******

### Unsupported operating systems

Binary packages *may* work on Ubuntu derivatives and Debian if the dependencies are satisfied; these configurations are known to work:
- Ubuntu 16.04 (Xenial) packages work on **Mint Linux 18** and on **Debian 9.0** (Stretch)
- Ubuntu 18.04 (Bionic) packages work on **Mint Linux 19** and on **Debian 10.0** (Buster)

These configurations however are not tested by our [continuous integration system](https://ci.openquake.org) and we cannot guarantee on the quality of the results. Use at your own risk.

Another installation option for unsupported Linux systems is provided by the **[self-installable binary distribution for generic Linux](installing/linux-generic.md)**.

******

### 32bit support

The OpenQuake Engine **requires a 64bit operating system**; 32bit systems are not officially supported and untested. Starting with version 2.3 of the Engine binary installers and packages aren't provided for 32bit operating systems anymore.

******

### Celery support

Starting with OpenQuake Engine 2.0 Celery isn't needed (and not recommended) on a single machine setup; the OpenQuake Engine is able to use all the available CPU cores even without Celery.
Celery must be enabled on a cluster / multi-node setup. To enable it please refer to the [multiple nodes installation guidelines](installing/cluster.md).

******

### MPI support

MPI is not supported by the OpenQuake Engine. Task distribution across network interconnected nodes is made via *Celery* and *RabbitMQ* as broker. No filesystem sharing is needed between the nodes and data transfer is made on plain TCP/IP connection. For a cluster setup see the [hardware suggestions](hardware-suggestions.md) and [cluster](installing/cluster.md) pages.

MPI support may be added in the future if sponsored by someone. If you would like to help support development of OpenQuake, please contact us at [partnership@globalquakemodel.org](mailto:partnership@globalquakemodel.org).

******

### Python scripts that import openquake

On **Ubuntu** and **RHEL** if a third party python script (or a Jupyter notebook) needs to import openquake as a library (as an example: `from openquake.commonlib import readinput`) you must use a virtual environment and install al local copy of the Engine:

```
$ python3 -m venv </path/to/myvenv>
$ . /path/to/myvenv/bin/activate
$ pip3 install openquake.engine
```

******

### Errors upgrading from an old version on Ubuntu

When upgrading from an OpenQuake version **older than 2.9 to a newer one** you may encounter an error on **Ubuntu**. Using `apt` to perform the upgrade you may get an error like this:

```bash
Unpacking oq-python3.5 (3.5.3-1ubuntu0~gem03~xenial01) ...
dpkg: error processing archive /var/cache/apt/archives/oq-python3.5_3.5.3-1ubuntu0~gem03~xenial01_amd64.deb (--unpack):
 trying to overwrite '/opt/openquake/bin/easy_install', which is also in package python-oq-libs 1.3.0~dev1496296871+a6bdffb
```

This issue can be resolved uninstalling OpenQuake first and then making a fresh installation of the latest version:

```bash
$ sudo apt remove python-oq-.*
$ sudo rm -Rf /opt/openquake
$ sudo apt install python3-oq-engine
```

******

### OpenQuake Hazardlib errors

```bash
pkg_resources.DistributionNotFound: The 'openquake.hazardlib==0.XY' distribution was not found and is required by openquake.engine
```
Since OpenQuake Engine 2.5, the OpenQuake Hazardlib package has been merged with the OpenQuake Engine one.

If you are using git and you have the `PYTHONPATH` set you should update `oq-engine` and then remove `oq-hazardlib` from your filesystem and from the `PYTHONPATH`, to avoid any possible confusion.

If `oq-hazardlib` has been installed via `pip` you must uninstall both `openquake.engine` and `openquake.hazardlib` first, and then reinstall `openquake.engine`.

```bash
$ pip uninstall openquake.hazardlib openquake.engine
$ pip install openquake.engine
# -OR- development installation
$ pip install -e /path/to/oq-engine/
```

If you are using Ubuntu or RedHat packages no extra operations are needed, the package manager will remove the old `python-oq-hazardlib` package and replace it with a fresh copy of `python3-oq-engine`.

On Ubuntu make sure to run `apt dist-upgrade` instead on `apt upgrade` to make a proper upgrade of the OpenQuake packages.

******

### 'The openquake master lost its controlling terminal' error

When the OpenQuake Engine is driven via the `oq` command over an SSH connection an associated terminal must exist throughout the `oq` calculation lifecycle.
The `openquake.engine.engine.MasterKilled: The openquake master lost its controlling terminal` error usually means that the SSH connection
has dropped or the controlling terminal has been closed having a running computation attached to it.

To avoid this error please use `nohup`, `screen`, `tmux` or `byobu` when using `oq` via SSH.
More information is available on [Running the OpenQuake Engine](running/unix.md).

******

### DbServer ports

The default port for the DbServer (configured via the `openquake.cfg` configuration file) is `1908` or `1907`.

******

### error: [Errno 111] Connection refused

A more detailed stack trace:

```python

    self.sock.connect(sa)
ConnectionRefusedError: [Errno 111] Connection refused
```

This happens when the **Celery support is enabled but RabbitMQ server is not running**. You can start it running
```bash
$ sudo service rabbitmq-server start
``` 

It may also mean that an incompatible version of Celery is used. Please check it with `/opt/openquake/bin/pip3 freeze`.

```

These errors mean that RabbiMQ _user_ and _vhost_ have not been created or set correctly. Please refer to [cluster documentation](installing/cluster.md#rabbitmq) to fix it.

******

### Swap partitions

Having a swap partition active on resources fully dedicated to the OpenQuake Engine is discouraged. More info [here](installing/cluster.md#swap-partitions).

******

### System running out of disk space

The OpenQuake Engine may require lot of disk space for the raw results data (`hdf5` files stored in `/home/<user>/oqdata`) and the temporary files used to either generated outputs or load input files via the `API`. On certain cloud configurations the amount of space allocated to the root fs (`/`) is fairly limited and extra 'data' volumes needs to be attached. To make the Engine use these volumes for `oqdata` and the _temporary_ storage you must change the `openquake.cfg` configuration; assuming `/mnt/ext_volume` as the mount point of the extra 'data' volume, it must be changed as follow:

- `shared_dir` must be set to `/mnt/ext_volume`
- A `tmp` dir must be created in `/mnt/ext_volume`
- `custom_tmp` must be set to `/mnt/ext_volume/tmp` (the directory must exist)
