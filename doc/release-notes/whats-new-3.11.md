Release notes v3.11
===================

This is a major release featuring several optimizations, new features,
and bug fixes. Nearly 400 pull requests were merged.

For the complete list of changes, see the changelog:
https://github.com/gem/oq-engine/blob/engine-3.11/debian/changelog

Here are the highlights.

## New features

The classical PSHA calculator has a brand new optimization called
*point source gridding*, based on the idea of using a raw grid of point
sources for distant sites and a fine grid for close sites.
The feature is still experimental and not enabled by default, but the
first results are very encouraging: up to 3Ã— improvement in the runtimes
of a few large continental models without reduction in the accuracy of the
results. The point source gridding optimization is documented here:

https://docs.openquake.org/oq-engine/advanced/point-source-gridding.html

and you are invited to try it.

There is also a new syntax to perform sensitivity analysis, i.e. to
run multiple calculations with different values of one (or more)
parameters. This can be used to test the sensitivity to the parameters
used in the point source gridding approximation, but in general it
works for any global parameter. An example to assess the sensitivity
to the integration distance is the following:
```
sensitivity_analysis = {'maximum_distance': [200, 300]}
```
Finally, now the engine can automatically download and run
calculations from an URL containing a .zip archive. For instance

```
$ oq engine --run "https://github.com/gem/oq-engine/blob/engine-3.11/openquake/server/tests/data/classical.zip?raw=true"
```

## Hazard calculators

The memory occupation of classical PSHA calculations has been reduced
significantly; for instance, models that used to require
over 100 GB of RAM on the master node now runs with less than 32 GB
on the master node. We also optimized the calculation of the
probability of exceedence by carefully generating arrays with a size
smaller than the CPU cache (that can give a speedup of a factor 2 or 3).

A time-honored performance hack in event based calculations with full
enumeration of the logic-tree has been finally removed: now the number 
of generated ruptures is consistent with the case of sampling of the 
logic-tree. This helps removing a source of confusion that was always
present before. Event based calculations involving full-enumeration
of the logic-tree are likely to require additional runtime now, but 
the calculations are manageable, whereas previously they might not
have run to completion.

The scenario and event based calculators have been fully unified
within the engine internals. As a consequence, the parameter controlling
the rupture seeds is now always `ses_seed`. Before it was `ses_seed` in
event based but `random_seed` in scenario, a potential source of 
confusion for the users since `random_seed` was also used for the 
logic-tree sampling. 
Please read the [FAQ section on the seeds](https://github.com/gem/oq-engine/blob/engine-3.11/doc/faq-risk.md#what-implications-do-random_seed-ses_seed-and-master_seed-have-on-my-calculation) used by the engine for more details.

We changed the algorithm generating the rupture seeds, thus the engine
will not produce the same GMFs as before, but they will still be
statistically equivalent.

We refined the "minimum_intensity" approximation, by making it more precise:
ground motion values below the specified threshold are replaced with zeros and
not stored *if and only if* they are below the threshold for *all* intensity measure types.

We improved the task distribution in event based calculations, because sometimes
it was producing too many tasks and sometimes sending the
tasks to the workers was excessively slow.

We changed the task distribution also in scenario calculations: now we
parallelize by `number_of_ground_motion_fields` if there are more than
10 sites. This improved a lot the performance in cases with many
thousands of sites.

The `scenario` and `event_based` calculators (including `ebrisk`) now generate
and store as a pandas-friendly dataset the (geometrically) averaged GMF
on the events. This is useful for plotting and debugging purposes.

We reduced the data transfer due to the GMPEs (in particular the Kotha
GMPEs): in some cases, this can make a huge difference (we saw a 10x
reduction in the newest model for Europe) while for most models you
may not see any sensible difference.

The preclassical calculator has been made faster and improved to
determine the source weights more reliably, thus reducing the slow
task issue in classical calculations. Now all sources are split and
prefiltered with a KDTree in the preclassical phase.

We changed the semantics of the `pointsource_distance` approximation:
before it was ignoring finite size effects, now it is just averaging them,
so it is much more precise than before.

For calculations with a few sites now we store the classical ruptures in a
single pandas-friendly dataset, including information about the
generating sources.

We worked on improving the UCERF calculator, doing some minor optimizations, 
but a lot more could be done to improve its performance.

## Risk calculators

The `scenario_risk` and `event_based_risk` calculator have been unified, as
well as the `scenario_damage` and `event_based_damage` calculators, so do not
worry if when running a `scenario_risk` calculation the progress log will say
that you are running an `event_based_risk` calculation. The core calculation
logic used for the calculations within the engine is the same now.

We added the ability to compute aggregate losses to the scenario calculators
and aggregate loss curves to the `event_based_risk` calculator. Notice, however,
that they are still less efficient than the `ebrisk` calculator, which should
be the preferred calculator when attempting to compute aggregated loss curves.

We optimized the case of many tags so that now it is possible to
aggregate by asset ID or by site ID by setting in the job.ini file

```ini
  aggregate_by = id  ## compute loss curves for each asset
  aggregate_by = site_id  ## compute loss curves aggregated by site
```

This works up to many thousands of assets/sites; previously it was 
simply impossible due to memory issues.

There was a huge speedup in large `ebrisk` calculations due to the removal of
zero losses (we measured a 7x speedup in a calculation in test runs for NRCan).

The risk model (which comprises fragility functions, vulnerability functions,
consequence models, and taxonomy mapping tables) is now stored in a 
pandas-friendly way; that improves by two orders of magnitude the 
saving time in calculations with many thousands of vulnerability/fragility functions.

The `scenario_damage` calculator is more efficient than before and it stores
the damage distributions in a pandas-friendly way. It also stores a
dataset `avg_portfolio_damage` useful for comparison purposes.

The CSV exporters have been updated to use pandas, thus improving the
performance. Moreover various exporters have been changed in order to
unify the aggregate losses outputs between `ebrisk`,
`event_based_risk` and `scenario_risk` calculators. The most notable
change is that the exporter for the loss curves aggregated by tag now
also exports the total loss curve (in the same file). Here is an example:

https://github.com/gem/oq-engine/blob/engine-3.11/openquake/qa_tests_data/event_based_risk/case_6c/expected/agg_curves_eb.csv

## Logic trees

We made the engine smarter in the presence of different sources with
the same ID, which are unavoidable in presence of logic trees changing
the source parameters. Now internally the engine uses an unique
ID. For instance in the case of two different sources with ID "A", the
engine will generate two IDs: "A;0" and "A;1". The information about
the sources is now stored in a pandas-friendly dataset `source_info`
with an unique index `source_id`.

Whe changed the internal storage of the PoEs in classical calculations
to allow a substantial optimization of performance and memory
occupation: this improvement is visible only in calculations with particularly
complex logic trees. While at it, we fixed a bug in the sampling logic 
affecting some models in engine 3.10.

We changed the string representation of the realizations to make it
more compact (before it was practically impossible to print out the
full names of the realizations for some models, because the strings were too long).

We added a check on valid branch ID names: only letters, digits and the
caracter "-", "_" an "." are accepted.

We added a new type of uncertainty for the seismic sources
called `TruncatedGRFromSlipAbsolute`. That required adding
a classmethod `TruncatedGRMFD.from_slip_rate` and to update the I/O
routines to recognize the `slip_rate` parameter.

## hazardlib/HTMK

We introduced a new MFD parameter `slipRate` and implemented a new GMPE
`AvgPoeGMPE` performing averages on the probabilities of exceedence:
this is an alternative approach to the `AvgGMPE`, which performs
geometric averages on the GMFs.

The `AvgGMPE`, introduced over an year ago, has been extended to work
also for scenario and event based calculations and has been documented here:

https://docs.openquake.org/oq-engine/advanced/mean-ground-motion-field.html

The `ModifiableGMPE` was enhanced with new methods set_scale_median_scalar,
set_scale_median_vector, set_scale_total_sigma_scalar,
set_scale_total_sigma_vector, set_fixed_total_sigma,
set_total_std_as_tau_plus_delta, add_delta_std_to_total_std.

[Richard Styron](https://github.com/cossatot) introduced a tapered 
Gutenberg-Richter MFD, closely following its implementation in the
USGS NSHMP-HAZ code.

[Marco Pagani](https://github.com/mmpagani) introduced a new distance 
called  'closest_point' and a method to create a `TruncatedGRMFD` 
from a value of scalar seismic moment. Moreover he also introduced 
a KiteSurface class and and KiteFaultSource class, which at the moment 
are still considered experimental.

[Viktor Polak](https://github.com/viktor76525) contributed the GMPE Parker et al (2020).
He also contributed the Hassani and Atkinson (2020) GMPE and added a new
site parameter `fpeak`. Finally he contributed the GMPEs Chao et al. (2020)
and Phung et al. (2020).

[Laurentiu Danciu](https://github.com/danciul) and 
[Athanasios Papadopoulos](https://github.com/thpap) contributed several
intensity prediction equations for use in the Swiss National Earthquake Risk Model.
The new IPEs refer to models obtained from the ECOS (2009), Faccioli and 
Cauzzi (2006), Bindi et al. (2011), and Baumont et al. (2018) studies.
They also extended the `ModifiableGMPE` class to allow amplification of the
intensity of the parent IPE based on a new `amplfactor` site parameter.

[Graeme Weatherill](https://github.com/g-weatherill) made some updates to 
the GMPEs used in the European Seismic Hazard Model 2020 (ESHM20).

[Claudia Mascandola](https://github.com/mascandola) contributed the
GMPE Lanzano et al. (2019) and the NI15 regional GMPE by Lanzano et al. (2016).

We changed the `SourceWriter` not to save the `area_source_discretization`
on each source when writing the XML files, otherwise the same parameter
in the `job.ini` file would be ignored, which is normally undesirable.

## Bugs

A regression entered in the `classical_risk` and `classical_damage`
calculators in engine 3.10 causing an increase of the data transfer
in hazard curves. That was killing the performance in the case of
calculations with many thousands of sites. Fixed after a report by the
[EUCENTRE](https://www.eucentre.it/).

The exporters for the hazard maps and UHS were exporting zeros in the case of
`individual_curves = true`. Fixed after the report by Jian Ma 
(https://groups.google.com/g/openquake-users/c/43flYFzOMoo/m/tpYFqv1pBAAJ).

In presence of an unknown parameter in the `job.ini` file - typically because
of a mispelling - the log was disappearing; this has been fixed.

The boolean fields `vs30measured` and `backarc` were not cast correctly
when read from a CSV field (the engine was reading the zeros as true values).
Fixed after the report by Peter PaÅ¾Ã¡k (https://groups.google.com/u/0/g/openquake-users/c/-8Abgea_Pu8/m/IHM0o68rDgAJ).

We fixed a wrong check raising a `ValueError` incorrectly in the case of
multi-exposures with multiple cost types.

We fixed a bug in the calculation of average losses in
`scenario_risk` computations: events with zero losses that were
incorrectly discarded.

Now `ignore_covs = 0` effectively sets *all* the coefficients of variation
in the input vulnerability functions to zero, 
even when using the Beta distribution, which was not the case in previous 
versions.

## New checks and warnings

We removed some annoying warnings in classical_damage calculations
in the case of hazard curves with PoEs == 1.

The engine logs a warning in case of a suspiciously large seed dependency
in event-based/scenario calculations.

The engine raises an early error if the parameter `soil_intensities`
is set with an amplification method which is not "convolution".

The engine raises an early error in case of zero probabilities in the hypocenter
distribution or the nodal plane distribution in the XML source files.

We added a check on the vulnerability functions
with the Beta distribution: the mean loss ratios cannot contain zeros unless the
corresponding coefficients of variation are zeros too.

Now we perform the disaggregation checks before starting the classical
part of the calculation, so that the user gets an early error in case
of wrong parameters.

The engine warns the user if it discover a situation with zero losses
corresponding to non-zero GMFs.

We now accept vulnerability functions for taxonomies missing in the
exposure: such functions are just ignored. This is useful since it
means that a vulnerability model file prepared for a full exposure
can be used on a reduced exposure missing some taxonomy strings.

## oq commands

We replaced the command `oq workers inspect` with `oq workers status`.

We renamed `oq recompute_losses` as `oq reaggregate` and made it to work
properly.

We enhanced the command `oq compare` and extended it also to the `avg_gmf`
outputs.

We improved a fixed a few `oq plot` subcommands.

We enhanced `oq plot sources` to plot point sources and to manage the
internationa date line.

We fixed a bug in `oq prepare_site_model` ` when `sites.csv` is
the same as the `vs30.csv` file and there is a grid spacing parameter.

The command `oq nrml_to` has been documented.

## WebUI/WebAPI/QGIS plugin

If the authentication is off now the WebUI shows the calculations of
all users and not only the calculations of the current user.

We improved the submission of calculations to the WebAPI: now they can
be run on a full cluster, `serialize_jobs` is honored and the log level is
configurable with a variable `log_level` in the file `openquake.cfg`.

We updated the QGIS plugin to reflect the changes in the engine outputs.

## Other

The flag `--reuse-hazard` has been replaced by a flag `-reuse-input`
that allows the user to reuse only source models and exposures. This is safer
than trying to reuse the GMFs, which should be done with the `--hc`
option instead.

The `num_cores` parameter has been moved from the `job.ini` file to the
`openquake.cfg` file and now it works as expected.

There was a lot of work on secondary perils, both on the hazard and on
the risk side, but the feature is still not ready for primetime.

## Packaging

We now have a universal installer working on Linux, Windows and Mac
(see https://github.com/gem/oq-engine/blob/engine-3.11/doc/installing/universal.md).

The universal installer is now the only supported way to install the engine on Mac
and generic Linux systems. It works by using a pre-installed Python, which can
be Python 3.6.x, 3.7.x. or 3.8.x. Python 3.9 is not supported yet; if you have an older
Python (â‰¤3.5) you must install a newer, supported version of Python
and only then proceed with installing the engine.

For Debian-based systems the universal installer works just fine, but we also
provide packages that include their own Python (version 3.8).

For RedHat-based systems we also provides packages that include their
own Python (version 3.6). Notice that due to the change of policy of
RedHat about the CentOS operating system, it is not clear if we will
keep supporting it with the packages, but the universal installer will work.

We upgraded h5py to version 2.10 (for performance improvements) and shapely
to version 1.7.1 (to unofficially support macOS Big Sur). Notice that 
*macOS Big Sur is still not officially supported* since we cannot reliably 
run tests for the engine on Big Sur, given that GitHub's
Continuous Integration system does not support it yet. But we know of
several users for whom the engine works on Big Sur, via the universal
installer. The latest generation of MacBooks based on the Apple M1 CPU
architecture, i.e., the MacBook Air (M1, 2020), Mac mini (M1, 2020), 
and the MacBook Pro (13-inch, M1, 2020) are not officially supported.
