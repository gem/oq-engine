# OpenQuake Engine Server REST API

## Introduction

oq engine server provides a series of REST API methods for running calculations, checking calculation status, and browsing and downloading results.

All responses are JSON, unless otherwise noted.

#### GET /v1/calc/:calc_id/result/list

Same as GET /v1/calc/:calc_id/results


#### GET /v1/calc/result/:result_id

Get the full content of a calculation result for the given `result_id`.

Parameters:

    * export_type: the desired format for the result (`xml`, `geojson`, etc.)
    * dload: `true` to force download, not `true` try to open in browser window

Response:

The requested result as a blob of text. If the desired `export_type` is not supported, an HTTP 404 error is returned.


#### GET /v1/calc/:calc_id/log/[:start]:[:stop]

Get a slice of the calculation log for the given `calc_id`, from `start`
to `stop`. If `start` is the empty string, consider it `0` and starts
from the beginning. If `stop` is the empty string, gives all the
available lines. For instance `http://host/v1/calc/123/log/:` gives the
complete log for calculation 123.

Parameters: None

Response:

The requested log slice as a JSON list of rows


#### GET /v1/calc/:calc_id/log/size

Get the (current) number of lines of the calculation log for the given
`calc_id`.

Parameters: None

Response:

The number of lines of log


#### GET v1/calc/:calc_id/datastore

Get the HDF5 datastore for the calculation identified by the parameter `calc_id`.


#### POST /v1/calc/:calc_id/remove

Remove the calculation specified by the parameter `calc_id`.


#### POST /v1/calc/run

Run a new calculation with the specified job config file, input models, and other parameters.

Files:

    * job_config: an oq engine job config INI-style file
    * input_model_1 - input_model_N: any number (including zero) of input model files

Parameters:

    * hazard_job_id: the hazard calculation ID upon which to run the risk calculation; specify this or hazard_result (only for risk calculations)
    * hazard_result: the hazard results ID upon which to run the risk calculation; specify this or hazard_job_id (only for risk calculations)

Response: Redirects to [/v1/calc/:calc_id](#get-v1calchazardcalc_id), where `calc_id` is the ID of the newly created calculation.


#### POST /v1/calc/aelo_run

Run a new aelo calculation for a site with the specified parameters.

Parameters:

    * lon: the longitude of the site (a float in the interval [-180, +180])
    * lat: the latitude of the site (a float in the interval [-90.0, +90.0])
    * vs30: the time-averaged shear-wave velocity from the surface to a depth of 30 meters (a positive float)
    * siteid: an ID to assign to the site (the only accepted chars are a-zA-Z0-9_-:)

Response:

    The input values are validated and a `400 Bad Request` response is returned
    in case any invalid input is found, specifying the reason of the failure.
    If inputs are valid, the engine will first attempt to identify a Mosaic
    model that covers the given site, returning a `400 Bad Request` response in
    case the site does not belong to any of the Mosaic models. Otherwise, a new
    job is created and a `200 OK` response is returned, like:

    {"status": "created",
     "job_id": 1,
     "outputs_uri": "http://localhost:8800/v1/calc/1/results",
     "log_uri": "http://localhost:8800/v1/calc/1/log/0:",
     "traceback_uri": "http://localhost:8800/v1/calc/1/traceback"}

    `outputs_uri` can be used later to retrieve calculation results, after the job is complete.
    `log_uri` can be called to get the log of the calculation, either while it is still running or after its completion.
    `traceback_uri` can be called in case of job failure (and only after it occurs), to retrieve a full traceback of the error.

As soon as the job is complete, a notification is automatically sent via email to the user
who launched it. In case of success, the message will contain a link to the web page showing
the outputs of the calculation; otherwise, it will describe the error that occurred.

#### POST /v1/calc/validate_zip

Check if a given job.zip archive is valid

Parameters:

    * archive: the zip file to be validated

Response:

a JSON object, containing:

    * valid: a boolean indicating if the provided archive is a valid job.zip

#### POST /v1/valid/

Check if a given XML text is a valid NRML.

Parameters:

    * xml_text: the text of the xml to be validated as nrml

Response:

a JSON object, containing:

    * valid: a boolean indicating if the provided text is a valid NRML
    * error_msg: the error message, if any error was found (None otherwise)
    * error_line: line of the given XML where the error was found (None if no error was found or if it was not a validation error)


#### POST /v1/on_same_fs

Response:

a JSON object, containing:
