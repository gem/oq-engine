It is now possible to perform a sensitivity analysis, i.e. to run multiple
calculations with different values of one ore more parameters with a single
command.

Source IDs are now unique internally.

It is possibile to set `num_cores` in openquake.cfg.

# Optimizations

We can now row Australia with 48 GB.

We optimized the GMF saving and export by using pandas.
We worked at the UCERF calculator.
Optimized get_poes and the storage of _poes.
We optimized spectacularly the performance of calculations with particularly
complex logic trees, like the South Africa (ZAF) model.
There is a logic tree path shortener.
We now store the ruptures in a single pandas-friendly dataset, including
information about the generating source.
Changed the source seed algorithm.

# Risk calculators

There was a huge speedup in ebrisk calculation due to the removal of
zero losses.
There was a lot of work on secondary perils.
Added portfolio_damage_error view.
