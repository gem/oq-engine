In this demonstration loss curves are computed based on probabilistic seismic
hazard, using a stochastic event set-based approach. 

A hypothetical exposure model containing the economic value of 3276 assets
(distributed across 1092 sites) and comprising 3 different building typologies
(masonry, low-rise and mid-rise concrete buildings) is provided. In these
calculations, a region that covers a smaller portion of the exposure model was
defined, covering 423 assets (distributed throughout 141 sites).  The
vulnerability model uses peak ground acceleration and each vulnerability
function is defined in a discrete way which means that a loss ratio and
associated uncertainty is provided for a list of intensity measure levels.  

About 50 realizations of the seismicity history, each with a 50 years time
span, are used in this demo and the spatial correlation of the ground motion is
taken into account. 

In addition to the loss curves for each asset that are produced (making a total
of 423 loss curves), also a loss curve representing the aggregated losses from
all assets is computed.  

This demo is expected to take about 25 minutes to complete using OATS.
