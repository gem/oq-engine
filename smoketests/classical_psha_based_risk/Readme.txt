In this demonstration loss curves are computed based on probabilistic seismic hazard, through a classical PSHA-based approach. 

A hypothetical exposure model containing the economic value of 3276 assets (distributed across 1092 sites) and comprising 3 different building typologies (masonry, low-rise and mid-rise concrete buildings) is provided.  In these calculations, a region that covers a smaller portion of the exposure model was defined, covering 423 assets (distributed throughout 141 sites). 
The vulnerability model uses peak ground acceleration and each vulnerability function is defined in a discrete way which means that a loss ratio and associated uncertainty is provided for a list of intensity measure levels.

Only one branch of the logic tree is being considered and a loss curve for each asset is produced (making a total of 423 loss curves). 

This demo is expected to take about 1 minute to complete using OATS.
