=====
nhlib (a New Hazard Library) is open-source software for performing
seismic hazard analysis.

What is nhlib?
--------------
nhlib includes modules for modeling seismic sources (point, area and fault),
earthquake ruptures, temporal (e.g. Poissonian) and magnitude occurrence
models (e.g. Gutenberg-Richter), magnitude/area scaling relationships,
ground motion and intensity prediction equations (i.e. GMPEs and IPEs).
Eventually it will offer a number of calculators for hazard curves,
stochastic event sets, ground motion fields and disaggregation histograms.

nhlib aims at becoming an open and comprehensive tool for seismic hazard
analysis. The GEM Foundation (http://www.globalquakemodel.org/) supports
the development of the  library by adding the most recent methodologies
adopted by the seismological/seismic hazard communities. Comments,
suggestions and criticisms from the community are always very welcome.

Requirements
------------
nhlib depends on numpy and scipy for fast numerical calculations and on
shapely for geometric primitives routines.

Development and support
-----------------------
nhlib is being actively developed by GEM foundation as a part of OpenQuake
project (though it doesn’t mean nhlib depends on openquake). The OpenQuake
development infrastructure is used for developing nhlib: the public repository
is available on github: http://github.com/gem/nhlib. Bugs can be reported
on launchpad: https://bugs.launchpad.net/openquake/. Mailing list is available
as well: http://groups.google.com/group/openquake-dev. You can also ask for
support on IRC channel #openquake on freenode.

Installation
------------
To install type as usual::

 python setup.py install
