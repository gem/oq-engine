Scenario Hazard Complex Fault Rupture Demo

This calculation demo exercises the Scenario hazard calculator by simlulating
a single rupture originating from a complex fault source.

In this example, we compute 10 sets of Ground Motion Fields for each IMT. Each
GMF covers the entire geographical area of interest (all 352 sites).

Expected runtime: <1 minute
Number of sites: 352
GMPEs: BooreAtkinson2008
IMTs: PGA, SA(0.1)
Outputs: Ground Motion Fields
