Classical PSHA Point Source Demo

This calculation demo exercises the Classical hazard calculator with a trivial
source model logic tree, containing a single model with a single point source.

In this example, we first compute hazard curves for all IMTs and sites of
interest (see below). From each curve set we interpolate hazard maps at 10% and
2% probabilities of exceedance. Finally, we also extract Uniform Hazard Spectra
(UHS) for the same probabilities from the PGA and SA hazard maps.

Expected runtime: ~1 minute
Number of sites: 1936
Number of logic tree realizations: 1
GMPEs: BooreAtkinson2008
IMTs: PGV, PGA, SA(0.025), SA(0.05), SA(0.1), SA(0.2), SA(0.5), SA(1.0), SA(2.0)
Outputs: Hazard Curves, Hazard Maps, UHS
