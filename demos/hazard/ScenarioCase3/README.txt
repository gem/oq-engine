Scenario Hazard Planar Rupture Demo

This calculation demo exercises the Scenario hazard calculator by simulating
a single rupture originating from a point source.

In this example, we compute 10 sets of Ground Motion Fields for each IMT. Each
GMF covers the entire geographical area of interest (all 352 sites).

Expected runtime: <<1 minute
Number of sites: 352
GMPEs: BooreAtkinson2008
IMTs: PGA
Outputs: Ground Motion Fields
