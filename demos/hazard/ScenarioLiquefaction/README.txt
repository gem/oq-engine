Scenario Hazard Liquefaction Single Plane Rupture Demo

This calculation demo exercises the Scenario liquefaction calculator by 
simulating a single rupture originating from a simple fault source.

In this example, we compute 10 sets of Ground Motion Fields for each PGV. 
Each GMF covers the entire geographical area of interest (all 4154 sites).

The site model contains all the necessary characteristics for liquefaction
assessment: Vs30, average precipitation, water table depth and distance to 
the nearest water body. The output of the analyses are ground motion fields,
liquefaction class (LiqOccur), and probability of liquefaction occurrence (LiqProb).

Expected runtime: <1 minute
Number of sites: 4154
GMPEs: AbrahamsonEtAl2014
IMTs: PGV
Outputs: Ground Motion Fields, LiqOccur, LiqProb
