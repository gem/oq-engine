This demo provides an example of a UHS calculation.

The source model logic tree contains only one source (for active shallow crust):
a square area source, with sides of 1 degree length. The middle point of the square
is at 0.0 lat and 0.0 lon.

The GMPE logic tree contains only one GMPE (Boore and Atkinson 2008).

UHS is computed on a single site (0.0, 0.0, the middle point of the source), for three periods (0.025, 0.45, 2.5), for two probabilities of exceedance (0.1, 0.02).
