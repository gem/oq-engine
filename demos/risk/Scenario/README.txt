Scenario Risk Demo

The demo consists of two parts: hazard and risk. The hazard and risk
calculations are defined in separate .ini files and were designed to be
run together to form a complete end-to-end demonstration of the workflow.

--Hazard--
Expected runtime: <1 minute
Outputs: Ground Motion Fields

--Risk--
