Stochastic Event-based Damage Demo
----------------------------------

This example computes average damage distributions, aggregate damage
distributions and damages at a return period of 500 years for an event
based damage calculation with 50 samples taken from 486 potential
realizations. There are 1047 buildings on 6 assets on 6 distinct sites.

**Expected Runtimes and Outputs**

Expected runtime for event damage calculation: ~1 minute

Outputs:

- Aggregate Risk Curves
- Aggregated Risk By Event
- Asset Damage Distributions
- Earthquake Ruptures
- Ground Motion Fields
