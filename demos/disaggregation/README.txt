This demo provides an example of a Disaggregation hazard calculation.

The input source model is composed of area sources derived from the GSHAP
hazard model for South East Asia.

The source model logic tree contains only the source model; no additional
epistemic uncertainties are considered.

The GMPE logic tree contains only one GMPE (Boore and Arkinson 2008) associated
to the Shall Active Crust (all of the sources are marked as Shallow Active
Crust).

The configuration file (config.gem) is set to compute disaggregation results
for a small region (2 by 2 degrees) located in India.

TODO: What are the output files/artifacts generated by this calculation?
