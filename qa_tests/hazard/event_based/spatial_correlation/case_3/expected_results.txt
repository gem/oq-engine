This test is expected to compare the theoretically derived joint
probabilities of occurrence of a set of ground motion levels at the
two sites of interest with those derived by processing the entire set
of GMFs produced by the calculation.

For PGA = 0.5, the joint probability of occurrence is 0.95
For PGA = 1.0, the joint probability of occurrence is 0.22
