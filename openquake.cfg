[hazard]
# The number of work items per task. In the case of the classical calculator,
# this indicates the number of sources to consider per task. In the case of
# the event based calculator, this parameter is ignored and the block_size
# is automatically determined. For the scenario calculator this parameter
# is ignored too: at the moment a distribution per site with a hard coded block
# size of 1000 is used. For the disaggregation calculator, this parameter
# is used both in the first part of the computation, which distributes over
# sources, and in the second part of the computation, which distributes
# over sites
block_size = 1

# When the task items are seismic sources, treat point sources differently.
# Since the computation time for a point source is typically much less
# than area or fault sources, we want to group them together in larger
# chunks for calculation efficiency.
# In the tests that have been done until now, we found that 200-300 point
# sources per task is optimal, whereas 1 area or fault source (simple,
# complex, or characteristic) per task is optimal.

# Ideally, this would be set to at least number of available worker processes.

# queue equal to 2 * the number of worker processes. This makes a big difference
# in large calculations.
