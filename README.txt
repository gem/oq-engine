OpenQuake is an open source application that allows users to
compute seismic hazard and seismic risk of earthquakes on a global scale.

Please note: the /usr/bin/openquake script requires a celeryconfig.py
file in the PYTHONPATH.  Please make sure this is the case and that your
celeryconfig.py file works with your python-celery setup.

Feel free to copy /usr/openquake/celeryconfig.py and revise it as needed.
